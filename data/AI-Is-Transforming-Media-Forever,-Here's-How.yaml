    done, you’ll be able to let it loose on the world without having to write every
    single day. The same thing goes for interviewing—you’ll still have to spend time
    asking good questions (though AI might help even with that). But turning a conversation
    into a transcript into a readable interview might soon be a far less time-consuming
    project than it is today. It’s also possible that readers will prefer to own the
    summarizer themselves and curate it according to their own preferences—à la my

- en: The problem is that writing good blog posts is a complex skill. There are actually
    very few people in the world who can do it well. There are even fewer who can
    do it consistently. There are even fewer who are crazy enough to want to do it.
    Writers like me revel in harvesting weird ideas into letters on a page. These
    are the only kind of people that tend to put in enough hours to actually learn
    how to make writing that spreads.

  zh: 写好博客文章是一项复杂的技能。实际上，世界上能做到这一点的人非常少。能够持之以恒地做到的人更少。甚至还有更少的人愿意这样做。像我这样的作家热衷于将奇怪的想法收割成页面上的文字。这些往往是唯一愿意投入足够时间去真正学会传播文字的人。
- en: When your supply of writing consists of one-off posts from non-professionals,
    you tend to get bad-quality writing with surface-level PR-fluff marketing content.

    conversation into a good tweet, or essay, or maybe even a book. In turn, it may
    bring Medium’s original dream a lot closer to reality.

  zh: 特别是，它甚至可能发展到足以将一次非常有趣的对话转化为一条好推文，或者一篇文章，甚至可能是一本书。进而，这可能会让 Medium 的原始梦想更加接近现实。
- en: This will be incredibly important because it will open up new vistas for writing
    that were never previously available. For example, take the business world. From
    the beginning of Every, we’ve noticed that the best ideas in business are never
    written down—they’re locked up in people’s heads. You’ll hear them on a Zoom call
    with a famous investor, or at an impromptu dinner with a few founders who happen
    to be in town. These are things said by people with a twinkle in their eye, and
    that might make you see the world differently or change the trajectory of your
    business. But these ideas don’t spread because whoever said them doesn’t necessarily
    have the skills to write about them.

  zh: 这将非常重要，因为它将打开以前从未有过的写作新视野。例如，看看商界。从 Every 的开端，我们就注意到商界最好的想法从来都没有被记录下来——它们被锁在人们的头脑中。你会在与著名投资者的
    Zoom 电话会议中听到它们，或者在与几位碰巧在城里的创始人临时晚餐时听到它们。这些是由眼中闪烁着光芒的人说出的话，这些话可能让你以不同的方式看待世界，或者改变你的业务轨迹。但是这些想法并没有传播开来，因为说出它们的人并不一定有写作的技能。
- en: Part of the mission of Every is to bring these ideas to life on the page—but
    for now, it’s been slow, difficult, and expensive. We do a lot of interviews with
    people for this purpose, and we’ve also dabbled in ghostwriting. But it’s a fundamentally
    talent-constrained endeavor. Good ghostwriters are incredibly rare, and they can
    only work with a few people at a time.

  zh: Every 的使命之一是将这些想法活跃起来——但是目前来说，这是缓慢、困难且昂贵的。我们为此目的进行了许多人物采访，还尝试过幽灵写作。但这是一项根本上受才能限制的工作。好的幽灵写手非常罕见，而且他们一次只能与几个人合作。
- en: 'AI changes this equation significantly. We’re already starting to see how AI
    makes interviewing easier to do: It’s brought down the cost of producing a basic
    transcript significantly. We’re starting to tinker with doing more on this front,
    using it to take a basic transcript and polish it into a more final form. It’s
    still early, but it looks like it could work. If it does, it might be able to
    help with the even more complex task of ghostwriting. This will dramatically expand
    the number of high-quality posts we can publish from people who don’t consider
    themselves writers but who have incredible ideas about business. I can see this
    holding true in a lot of other subject areas.'

  zh: 人工智能显著改变了这个方程式。我们已经开始看到人工智能如何使采访更容易进行：它大大降低了制作基本转录的成本。我们开始尝试在这方面做更多的尝试，利用它将基本转录变得更加完善。现在还只是初期阶段，但看起来可能行得通。如果可以的话，它可能会有助于更复杂的代笔任务。这将大大扩大我们可以从那些不认为自己是作家但对业务有着不可思议想法的人那里发布的高质量文章的数量。我可以看到这在很多其他领域也是如此。

    is able to automate certain types of content creation, unbundle research from
    narrative, and help to write unwritten stories…what happens then?

- en: For example, in BuzzFeed’s early days, CEO Jonah Peretti created a bot called
    [LilyBoo](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lilyboo) that would help him trawl through
    Pinterest posts looking for maximally cute pictures of dogs, cats, and more. The
    pictures were then gathered into a list format and published.

  zh: 例如，在BuzzFeed的早期，首席执行官Jonah Peretti创建了一个名为[LilyBoo](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lilyboo)的机器人，帮助他浏览Pinterest上的帖子，寻找最可爱的狗狗、猫猫等照片。然后，这些图片被整理成列表格式并发布。
- en: According to the excellent new book [*Traffic*](https://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Genius-Rivalry-Delusion-Billion-Dollar/dp/0593299752),
    by BuzzFeed’s former editor-in-chief Ben Smith, the idea for LilyBoo was, “machines,
    with a little human help, feeding culture back to itself, scaling to infinity.”
    LilyBoo, though, never quite took off. The problem was that there was “something
    sterile about simply, clinically, feeding people’s own social media posts back
    to them.”

  zh: 根据BuzzFeed的前总编辑本·史密斯的优秀新书[*Traffic*](https://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Genius-Rivalry-Delusion-Billion-Dollar/dp/0593299752)的说法，LilyBoo的想法是，“机器，再加上一点人类的帮助，将文化反馈给自己，无限扩展。”
    然而，LilyBoo从未完全起飞。问题在于，“简单地、临床地向人们反馈自己的社交媒体帖子，这种做法显得有些无趣。”
- en: This new generation of AI will face the same problem. GPT-4’s summarizing capabilities
    might be quite good—but they still lack the *zing* and voice of truly great human
    writing. Great writing—even when it’s de-risked—is still a complex activity where
    what it means to be “good” is changing all of the time. AI is still far off from
    being able to do that on its own. There’s a good chance it will get there over
    some long, undefined period of time, but anyone who uses these tools day-to-day
    can see they’ll need a lot of help for the foreseeable future.

- en: I’ve argued before that [AI will probably change the set of skills you need
    in order to be a writer](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/writing-essays-with-ai-a-guide),
    but that it won’t get rid of writers. That’s why I’m optimistic about approaches
    that intelligently blend what AI can do and what humans are great at. In an ideal
    world, these technologies give humans more time to do satisfying creative work
    at a higher level of ambition and scale and also make media businesses significantly
    easier to run predictably.
