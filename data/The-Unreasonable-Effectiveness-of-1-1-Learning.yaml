    article from our archive that I think is increasingly important. This one is about
    why 1-1 tutoring is so wildly effective—and how you can use it to learn anything.
    I originally wrote it almost a year ago, before tools like ChatGPT and GPT-4 were
    around. At the time, I argued that you could hire someone for surprisingly little
    money to be your personal tutor and learn anything. But with the advent of AI—this
    gets dramatically easier. Personalized tutoring is going to be broadly available
    to anyone with an internet connection and $20 / month. I think that''s a* ***great***
    *world to be in.*'

    up to this point. The reason is simple: I’d already done a lot of work on my novel,
    built up a decent amount of skill, but I was stuck in a few places and didn’t
    know how to build skill around them. Jack could help me identify where I was stuck

    First of all, if you’re working with someone who is a professional in their field
    you’re going to demonstrate that you’re worth their time. Sure, you’re paying
    them, but teaching isn’t their full-time job. They’re much more likely to find

  zh: 这在这里讨论的1对1辅导中并不是这样的情况。首先，如果你与某个领域的专业人士合作，你会证明你是值得他们时间的。当然，你付给他们钱，但教书不是他们的全职工作。他们更有可能发现有意愿在某个学科领域花费精力的人作为导师比起完全一无所知的人更具吸引力。

    with a syllabus and a plan for a “course” might be a tall order—so instead you’ll
    need to take charge of what you want to learn and why. Having some basic background
    knowledge will give you an idea of what’s confusing and what you want to get out
    of your experience. This will allow you to guide the tutor in the right direction.

  zh: 第二，如果你的导师不是专业教师，期望他们提出一个“课程”的大纲和计划可能有点困难——所以你需要负责你想学什么和为什么要学。具有一些基本背景知识将使你对什么是混乱的和你想要从你的经验中获得什么有一个概念。这将使你能够引导导师朝正确的方向发展。
- en: So before you get a tutor, try to get somewhere on your own first. Not only
    will this make you more likely to be able to work with someone that has a decent
    amount of knowledge and skill, it will also better prepare you to get something
    out of working with them. You’ll be able to come into your tutoring sessions with
    specific questions, or things you want to learn about which will make the process
    significantly more efficient than coming in cold.

- en: This might seem like a lot of work—and it’s not for everyone. If you want to

- en: When I was writing my novel I was doing 1-1 tutoring to refine a piece of work,
    but in order to do that I had to do a lot of skill building. But I think there
    are lots of other places 1-1 tutoring can help.

  zh: 当我写小说时，我做了一段时间的一对一辅导来优化一段作品，但为了做到这一点，我不得不进行很多技能的积累。但我认为一对一辅导还可以帮助很多其他方面。
- en: For example, for my next foray into this world I really want someone to teach
    me how to read scientific papers. Right now, I can understand enough to get by—but
    there’s a whole layer of X-Ray vision that academics can apply to understand whether
    a paper is good, what its flaws might be, and what the takeaways are that I’m
    just not exposed to as someone not reading them in a university environment.
