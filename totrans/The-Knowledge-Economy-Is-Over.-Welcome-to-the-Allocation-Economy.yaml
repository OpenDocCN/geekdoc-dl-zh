    the way I see the world. I’ve started to see ChatGPT as a summarizer of human
    knowledge, and once I made that connection, I started to see summarizing everywhere:
    in the code I write (summaries of what’s on StackOverflow), and the emails I send
    (summaries of meetings I had), and the articles I write (summaries of books I
    read).'

    But before it had been mostly invisible, bundled into an amorphous set of tasks
    that I’d called “intelligence”—things that only I and other humans could do. But
    now that I can use ChatGPT for summarizing, I’ve carved that task out of my skill
    set and handed it over to AI. Now, my intelligence has learned to be the thing
    that directs or edits summarizing, rather than doing the summarizing myself.
