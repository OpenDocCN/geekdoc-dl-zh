    Logan‚Äôs job is supporting the community of builders using ChatGPT, DALL-E, and
    the OpenAI API. He‚Äôs also deeply invested in growing this community, convinced
    that AI tools empower people to build more.

    a video game, live on the show. We use GPT Builder and ChatGPT to create [Allocator](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-oooxUbOkj-allocator),
    a text-based strategy game where players step into the shoes of a historical U.S.
    president and are tasked with managing the government‚Äôs budget. We have an awesome
    time iterating all the way from rough idea to functional video game in less than
    one hour‚Äîwithout any coding. It‚Äôs an incredible experiment in how AI can bring
    our creative ideas to life.

    that made our video game experiment possible: [GPT Builder](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor).
    This tool enables people to make custom GPTs tailored for pretty much [anything
    they want](https://openai.com/chatgpt#do-more-with-gpts). Logan believes that
    GPT Builder is the biggest technological unlock since ChatGPT was released. It
    reduces the barriers to innovation and building, especially for people who don‚Äôt
    know how to code.'

    Builder because it empowers people who don‚Äôt know how to code to build custom
    GPTs for themselves. ‚Äú[Y]ou can actually make something that is materially more
    useful than base ChatGPT itself without writing a single line of code,‚Äù he says.'

    coding know-how, Logan believes that learning to code is ‚Äúthe highest leverage
    thing you can do in your life.‚Äù AI is already enabling developers to tackle increasingly
    complex problems both faster and more independently, and he only anticipates this
    to ‚Äúexponentially‚Äù increase with time.'

    thinks AI will also teach the next billion people how to code. ‚Äú[T]here w[ere]
    not enough computer science educators and resources on the planet to teach the
    next billion people to code‚Ä¶ because we have LLMs, people are actually going to
    be empowered to go and do this in a way that''s personalized and empowering to
    them specifically,‚Äù he says.'

    build a video game that allows the player to choose a U.S. president and then
    allocate that government‚Äôs budget. On Logan‚Äôs advice, we don‚Äôt instruct GPT Builder
    to refine our rough prompt because, he explains, ‚Äú[W]e can iterate on it once
    we''ve actually gotten what [GPT Builder] outputted, but [GPT Builder] does do
    a little bit of that‚Ä¶prompt engineering magic behind the scenes for us.‚Äù The name
    we choose for our video game is Allocator, inspired in part by my [essay on the
    age of the allocation economy](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/the-knowledge-economy-is-over-welcome-to-the-allocation-economy).'

    your custom GPT to go viral: ‚Äú[N]ame [the custom GPT] something such that people
    will actually be able to find it,‚Äù Logan advises. To ‚Äúown the SEO space,‚Äù you
    need to think of a unique name because the ‚Äúmore generic that you make the name‚Ä¶the
    more polluted it‚Äôll be as somebody is trying to find it.‚Äù'

    building our video game, we uncover another prompt engineering nugget. We tell
    GPT Builder to simulate an expert and come up with a framework for gameplay mechanics
    because we aren‚Äôt technical specialists on the ‚Äúcore mechanics‚Äù of games.'

    ahead and outputs gameplay mechanics that fill in more gaps than we wanted. To
    limit this, Logan recommends clicking on the Configure tab to ‚Äútweak to those
    instructions to be like, ‚ÄòHey, maybe give the user some input and then let them
    go back and forth on some of these things.‚Äô‚Äù'

- en: '**Make with GPT Builder, refine with ChatGPT**. We still aren‚Äôt thrilled with
    the gameplay mechanics we get from GPT Builder, so Logan suggests using ChatGPT
    to refine the custom instructions powering the builder. ‚ÄúPart of the system prompt
    is to keep these custom instructions a little bit short and a little bit not too
    tactical,‚Äù he explains.'

- en: '**Use ChatGPT to format instructions.** We ask ChatGPT to format these instructions
    so that it‚Äôs easy for us to copy and paste them into GPT Builder. Logan‚Äôs helpful
    tip is to specifically instruct ChatGPT to output the instructions as ‚Äúmarkdown
    in a code block,‚Äù which deletes the bullet points.'

- en: As Logan and I play the game, we jot down a list of things we want to improve.
    Then we get ChatGPT to refine the instructions and input it back into GPT Builder,
    until we finally got to a version we were happy with. You can [play our game,
    Allocator](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-oooxUbOkj-allocator)‚Äîtell us what you think
    and we‚Äôll do a second episode to modify the game live based on your feedback.
