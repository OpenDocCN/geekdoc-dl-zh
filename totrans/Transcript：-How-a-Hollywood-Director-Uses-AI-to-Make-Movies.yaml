    Sora. In the piece, I cited Dave’s experience to argue that AI will change filmmaking
    by making movie concepts cheaper to test and big budget movies cost less, and
    leading to the emergence of a new art form. Here’s what I wrote:'

- en: “Dave Clark is a traditional filmmaker who has started to make AI-generated
    videos. He recently produced a sci-fi short called Borrowing Time that was inspired
    by his father’s experiences as a Black man in the 1960s. He produced it entirely
    using Midjourney and Runway to generate images and videos. He narrated the movie
    himself and used ElevenLabs to turn his voice acting into the voices of different
    characters.

    make it without AI. It would’ve been impossible to get a sci-fi short like his
    funded by a traditional Hollywood studio. But now that it’s out, and popular,
    he says that he’s fielding interest from top-tier Hollywood studios who would
    like to make it into a full-length movie.'
