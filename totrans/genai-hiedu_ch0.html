<p>Thinking back, it seems almost mad that we even attempted to write a book in just eight months &#x2013; especially during the last eight months I have been very busy with new responsibilities, having taken up the directorship of the newly structured teaching and learning centre at my university. On top of that, the ever-evolving landscape of Generative AI (GenAI)&#x2014;with its constant introduction of new apps, regulations, functions, and guidelines &#x2013; kept setting us backwards from our finishing line, forcing us to keep up with the latest developments. I remember my co-author Tom telling me, &#x201C;We need to revise the chapter again! Did you hear that ChatGPT can now recognise images?&#x201D; As much as I wanted to exclaim, &#x201C;Wow, cool!&#x201D; my actual response was, &#x201C;Oh, no!&#x201D; Despite that, our commitment remained: we wanted to bring the latest ideas, news, and practices to our readers, and we felt compelled to stay ahead of the curve. Thus, you will find very up-to-date news and references in the book. The content in some chapters is so cutting-edge that our primary sources were online forums, substack, LinkedIn, Facebook teachers&#x2019; groups, Twitter (X), newspapers, and YouTube; we must have joined so many Facebook, LinkedIn forums and discussion groups, and, naturally, engaged in extensive discussions with colleagues from universities and industries worldwide.</p>
<p>Being at the top-ranking university in Asia and the world, we often hold the centre stage. Given that the University of Hong Kong is the first university to have an AI policy and assessment guidelines in place (as far as we know), it was expected that news reporters would be interested in our work. Apart from the book, I also conducted a number of research projects in this area, and put together an AI literacy online course an assessment guidebook and infographics and leaflets on GenAI assessment (please visit the AI in education website at <a href="https://aied.talic.hku.hk">https://aied.talic.hku.hk/</a>). Looking around and speaking to the publisher, we believe this book will be the first on GenAI in higher education.</p>
<p>While this book is primarily for educators, I felt it would&#x2019; be incomplete without including the technical side of GenAI. Therefore, I invited Tom as my co-author. I am grateful to him, joining me in writing this book to check up on my AI know-how, making sure the tech parts are sound, given his current expertise in this domain. I must admit my technical background is a bit out-of-date.</p>
<p>As educators, we are always talking about an interdisciplinary focus, many bachelor programmes are no longer just a degree majoring in one discipline area but many. This book is interdisciplinary by nature; together, my co-author and I encompass both the educational and technical aspects. By merging education and engineering, we reflect the multi-faceted world we inhabit. Moreover, GenAI fosters collaboration across disciplines. Hence, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pxx" aria-label=" page xx. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>this book contains examples from all disciplines, assisting readers in grasping the expansive world of GenAI and interdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>In the book, we tried to use as many examples as we can to illustrate the different aspects of the power of GenAI. Knowing the readers of this book may be teachers, educational developers, policy writers from various disciplinary backgrounds and different types of post-secondary education institutions (such as community, vocational and technical colleges, research-intensive, and teaching-intensive universities), we made it a point to use straightforward language and terms that are not specific to educational research, and we hope that we have managed to make it readable and approachable for all readers.</p>
<p>GenAI&#x2019;s role in education is so new for the majority, we want to help readers to try out this new tool, not to be afraid of it, but to embrace it. Thus, wherever possible, we include examples, and even provide &#x2018;try-it-out&#x2019; prompts so readers can test them out. Any changes are not easy for our teachers, staff and policymakers; this book also raises the challenges not to underestimate the workload and hurdles through which teachers and supporting staff must jump. GenAI is driving us to revolutionise assessment in education. Recognising this transformative potential, in <a href="ch4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, we have developed an AI Assessment Integration Framework, together with an array of strategies and scenarios to effectively partner with GenAI in this domain. Since May, when a research article I authored on AI policy was published, I have been contacted by over 200 universities to discuss about how to devise an AI policy. Thus, in <a href="ch5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, we provide a step-by-step guide on how to devise an AI policy; in fact, we gave an example of what an AI policy should look like. Of course, if you wish to know more, please do contact us.</p>
<p>The examples, case studies, and focus of the book are written for post-secondary education; however, most of the content is suitable for different levels of education. School teachers and principals can adapt some of the strategies to suit the culture of their students and environments.</p>
<p>Each chapter begins with a quote that relates to the theme of the chapter, and the structure of the main body may differ depending on the theme of each chapter. The chapter ends with a section called <i>questions to ponder</i> and we included our own personal reflection after completing each chapter which diverges from the conventions of a typical academic book. This book is written for everyone &#x2013; academic developers, researchers, teachers, policymakers, students, IT and administrative staff, and parents. There are lots of useful &#x201C;freshly out of the oven&#x201D; research, guidelines, examples, frameworks and practices from this book and it may help to contemplate the kind of findings that are needed to support these practices and to generate theories and frameworks. The questions and reflections at the end of each chapter may also inspire research questions. At the end of the preliminary pages is a short summary of each chapter.</p></section></body></html>
