- en: RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is a larger set of techniques for using AI to augment
    or generate feedback data, including pairwise preferences [[227]](ch021.xhtml#ref-lee2023rlaif)
    [[228]](ch021.xhtml#ref-sharma2024critical) [[229]](ch021.xhtml#ref-castricato2024suppressing).
    There are many motivations to using RLAIF to either entirely replace human feedback
    or augment it. AI models are far cheaper than humans, with a single piece of human
    preference data costing on the order of $1 or higher (or even above $10 per prompt),
    AI feedback with a frontier AI model, such as GPT-4o costs less than $0.01\. This
    cost difference opens the market of experimentation with RLHF methods to an entire
    population of people previously priced out. Other than price, AI feedback introduces
    different *tradeoffs* on performance than human feedback, which are still being
    investigated. The peak performance for AI feedback is at least in the same ballpark
    of human data on skill-based evaluations, but it is not studied if human data
    allows finer control of the models in real-world product settings or for newer
    training methods such as character training.

    from AI Feedback* [[19]](ch021.xhtml#ref-bai2022constitutional), which resulted
    in initial confusion in the AI community over the relationship between the methods.
    Since the release of the Constitutional AI (CAI) paper and the formalization of
    RLAIF, RLAIF has become a default method within the post-training and RLHF literatures
    – there are far more examples than one can easily enumerate. The relationship
    should be understood as CAI was the example that kickstarted the broader field
    of RLAIF.'

    be using the same models for generating responses as those for generating critiques
    or ratings. Specifically, the calibration of the LLM-as-a-judge used has come
    into question. Several works have shown that LLMs are inconsistent evaluators
    [[231]](ch021.xhtml#ref-wang2023large) and prefer their own responses over responses
    from other models (coined self-preference bias) [[232]](ch021.xhtml#ref-panickssery2024llm).
