    kitchen, a battalion of clear glass cylinders that tapered slightly at the top

    bay leaves.'

    into a random order with my fingertips. Then, with darkness wrapped around me
    like a blanket, I’d pick one up, unscrew the top, raise it to my nose, and sniff.
    I’d try to measure the resulting experience as carefully as a drill sergeant inspecting
    the posture of a new recruit. I’d note the sharp burn of cinnamon, the sweet cloy
    of bay leaf, or the dollar-pizza texture of garlic powder. Then I’d make my choice:
    “Chili powder,” I’d say.'

    to words. Naming smells, in turn, helps you understand, refine, and communicate
    what you like and why. In short, naming is crucial to the development of taste.

    were seated next to each other, and when he tasted the wine they served, he immediately
    reeled off a vivid list of tasting notes that would make a master sommelier blush:
    “Big fruit on the nose, flowers, black plums, with a little bit of chocolate.”'

    see, the part of your brain that’s responsible for smells is naturally mute. It’s
    called the olfactory bulb, and it’s an ancient fist of neurons just behind your
    eyes. It has only indirect backroad connections to the parts of the brain that
    control language, like Broca’s area. So, even though you might have an easy time
    knowing whether or not you like a scent, it’s not easy to label that scent with
    a word. It’ll feel like groping through a dark closet for something you know is
    there, but can’t quite find.

    sitting in his apartment and notice when his neighborhood bakery was making his

    in a movie. Rather, it is a force to be called forth and deployed when needed.
    Cumin is a close-range tool, like a soldier armed with a cutlass or a crowbar.
    It’s best in chilis, soups, or meat dishes where each ingredient dukes it out
    with one another in hot combat in a large pot for many hours. It is not effective
    in lighter, cooler climes where subtler tools like butter or fresh basil are called
    for.
