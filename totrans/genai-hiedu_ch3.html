<p>It seems that GenAI&#x2019;s abilities go beyond advanced predictive text. It can reason, and relate concepts in complex ways. Yet it sometimes struggles with simple tasks. Maybe it isn&#x2019;t showing deep understanding, but rather mimicking human argument patterns through the data it trained from. It might be more of an &#x2018;accidental intelligence&#x2019; than &#x2018;artificial intelligence&#x2019;. Perhaps many humans also employ similar techniques.</p>

<h2 id="sec3_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.1 </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>The advancement of humanity will undoubtedly involve leveraging the benefits that Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and technologies offer, and, more specifically, leveraging these benefits as soon as they emerge, including those offered now by generative AI (GenAI). Simply put, we need to utilise all available intellectual resources to achieve the progress we desire. This is especially important for addressing significant global challenges such as environmental destruction from deforestation, the overexploitation of the Earth&#x2019;s resources, the detrimental impact of technology such as &#x2018;forever chemicals&#x2019;, and global warming.</p>
<p>Numerous tools and technologies have emerged over the last 20 years, which we now use in our daily lives. Typically, we quickly adopt these tools once they become accessible and affordable. This is particularly evident for mobile technology and the wide array of tools that accompany it (<a href="#ref3_1001" id="R_ref3_1001" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Bhavnani et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref3_5" id="R_ref3_5" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Brown &#x0026; Chalmers, 2003</a>; <a href="#ref3_19" id="R_ref3_19" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Law et al., 2018</a>). AI has already been seamlessly integrated into these tools in various forms, from biometrics for security and voice recognition for text messaging, to translation technology like Google Translate and search engine technologies like Google or Bing (<a href="#ref3_24" id="R_ref3_24" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Malhotra, 2020</a>). Mobile applications, including banking apps, e-commerce platforms like Amazon, and streaming services like Netflix, also have built-in AI functionalities, designed to enhance user safety and convenience while offering tailored product recommendations to improve user experience.</p>
<p>AI&#x2019;s presence is ubiquitous. For instance, when reaching out to public services companies, we are often greeted by an AI-powered customer service bot intended to streamline our experience. However, the current level of AI encountered by the general public may not always meet our expectations, leading to occasional frustrations, such as from dull and repetitive interactions with utility bots, or the occasional off-mark product recommendations from online retailers. This brings us to the questions at the heart of this chapter&#x2019;s rationale: To what extent can AI be beneficial in our curriculum? Do we know its strengths and weaknesses?</p>
<p>The goal of this chapter is to guide and enhance our understanding towards a more realistic awareness of text-based GenAI&#x2019;s capabilities in education, providing an overview of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p45" aria-label=" page 45. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>opportunities and threats that AI raises for education. In this chapter, each strength and weakness of GenAI is discussed with an example related to education, in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities. The examples also offer readers an opportunity to try out and gain insight into the capabilities and limitations of various tools. While ChatGPT is used in many of these examples given its current popularity, it is important to acknowledge that there are other tools with comparable abilities and potential impact.</p></section>

<h2 id="sec3_2"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.2 </span>ChatGPT and GenAI Text Tools</h2>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_2_1">
<h3 id="sec3_2_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.2.1 </span>What Is ChatGPT?</h3>
<p>ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a powerful large language model and functions as a text-based generative AI tool. Leveraging advanced GPT architecture, ChatGPT has the capacity to understand and generate human-like responses in natural language, making it a robust tool in diverse applications across different industries. Built upon a deep neural network that has been trained on a wide-ranging corpus of text, ChatGPT can engage in conversation, create cohesive and informative text, and answer queries by predicting the most probable subsequent words or sentences given an input (<a href="#ref3_20" id="R_ref3_20" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Leggatt et al., 2023</a>).</p>
<p>This model, although being trained extensively on data, does not actually know the specifics of the exact documents used in its training set, and does not have the ability to access or retrieve personal data unless explicitly required or provided in a conversation. <a href="ch6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> offers more detailed information regarding the technical aspects of how ChatGPT works.</p></section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_2_2">
<h3 id="sec3_2_2"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.2.2 </span>Common Functions of ChatGPT</h3>
<p>ChatGPT can perform a variety of functions, including engaging in dynamic conversations, answering queries, writing essays, summarising long documents, generating creative content like poems or stories in a particular style or format, synthesising informative text in a structured manner, translating languages, simulating characters for video games, and even generating programming codes. It is also capable of more carrying out advanced data analysis tasks. For example, it can interpret sets of data and explain the results of a complex data analysis, making it easier for non-experts to understand. Its flexible and adaptable text generation capabilities means it can also be configured or fine-tuned for specific applications, allowing it to cater to niche requirements and generate text that aligns with particular domain specifics or linguistic styles.</p>
<p>One of the latest features of ChatGPT (based on the most updated version as of 25 September 2023) is the ability to browse the web using Bing. This allows the model to pull in current information from the web and provide more up-to-date responses. It can also use plugins to extend its capabilities, including its new voice capability. In addition, DALL-E 3 has also recently been integrated into ChatGPT, allowing it to generate images from text descriptions provided by users (<a href="#ref3_26" id="R_ref3_26" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">OpenAI, 2023</a>).</p>
<p><b>Browse with Bing</b>: ChatGPT can now access and process information from the Internet through Bing search, which allows it to generate more accurate and up-to-date responses. This can be particularly useful in curriculum design as it allows for real-time access to the latest information, ensuring that educational content is up to date. For example, in a course on current events, ChatGPT can use Browse with Bing to refer to recent news articles relevant to the topic being discussed.</p>
<p><b><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p46" aria-label=" page 46. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>Advanced Data Analysis</b>: As mentioned, ChatGPT can perform complex data analysis tasks, such as identifying trends, patterns, and outliers. This can be used to generate insights into student learning data and other educational datasets. In addition, in a course setting, for instance in statistics or data sciences, students can input raw data into ChatGPT and the model would generate an analysis of that data, identifying similarities, and other key points of interest.</p>
<p><b>Plugins</b>: Plugins are additional features that can be added to ChatGPT to enhance its functionality. In terms of curriculum design, plugins could be developed to cater to specific educational needs. For example, a plugin could be created for language learning to provide translations, definitions, and language practice exercises.</p>
<p><b>Voice Capability</b>: The voice capability in ChatGPT, facilitated by OpenAI&#x2019;s Whisper, allows users to interact with the AI system using voice commands. This functionality is currently restricted to ChatGPT&#x2019;s mobile apps on iOS and Android platforms. Users have the option to activate this feature in their settings and select from five distinct output voices, each with its own tone and character. This addition extends the mode of interaction with ChatGPT beyond text-to-voice inputs, broadening the scope of user interaction. With the voice feature being mobile-centric, users have the flexibility to engage in verbal dialogues with ChatGPT while on the move, which could be handy in situations like seeking assistance with pronunciation during discussions.</p>
<p><b>DALL-E 3</b>: DALL-E 3 is an AI model that generates images from textual descriptions, and is now integrated into ChatGPT. This allows ChatGPT to generate text-to-image content such as diagrams, charts, and illustrations. For example, in an architecture course, students could use DALL-E 3 to create architectural models based on specific design briefs with specified backgrounds and landscapes.</p>
<p>Each of these functions offer unique benefits for curriculum design in higher education. By integrating AI into the learning process, educators can create more dynamic and interactive learning experiences that cater to a wide range of learning styles and learner needs.</p></section></section>

<section aria-labelledby="sec3_3_1">
<h3 id="sec3_3_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.3.1 </span>User-Centric Design</h3>
<p>The User-Centric Design characteristic of GenAI refers to the systematic approach of placing the user at the core of its design and development processes. User-centric design applications are easy to understand, simple to operate, and, above all, user-friendly (<a href="#ref3_11" id="R_ref3_11" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chow, 2023</a>). It involves the careful crafting of interfaces, functionalities, and processes that are inherently intuitive, thereby reducing the cognitive load on users and enabling them to interact with the system effortlessly. In GenAI, user-centric design translates to algorithms and models that not only produce high-quality outputs, but also ensure that the interaction, input methods, and result interpretations are straightforward and accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their technical proficiency. The goal of a user-centric design is to ensure that advanced AI technology is accessible and comprehensible to all. <a href="#fig3_1" id="R_fig3_1">Figures 3.1</a> and <a href="#fig3_2" id="R_fig3_2">3.2</a> show the user-friendly dialogue box of ChatGPT and Bard.</p>
<figure id="fig3_1"><img src="images/fig3_1_B.jpg" alt="The user interface of the Chat G T P website by Open A I which is very user-friendly and similar to a messenger application."/>

<p>From the user&#x2019;s standpoint, they can utilise natural language, text-based interfaces to interact with GenAI tools, often in conjunction with voice-based, image-based, gesture-based, and video-based interfaces. The user prompts the GenAI system with a question, comment, or statement, and receives a response from the system. This simple and easy-to-operate interaction style allows users to quickly understand how to use the tool, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p48" aria-label=" page 48. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>and derive value from it almost instantly. This type of interaction is familiar in educational settings, resembling a dialogue between a student (the user) and a tutor or teacher (the ChatGPT system). It is worth noting that the capability to interact with text is not only important but also practical, as we don&#x2019;t always desire vocalising thoughts (<a href="#ref3_23" id="R_ref3_23" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Long, 2018</a>), which is also one of the reasons for the popularity of many text-based messaging tools. According to studies (e.g., <a href="#ref3_13" id="R_ref3_13" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Edison Software, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref3_23" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Long, 2018</a>), both Gen-Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) and Millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) exhibit a preference for communication through texting over talking.</p></section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_3_2">
<h3 id="sec3_3_2"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.3.2 </span>Humanistic Conversational Style</h3>
<p>A humanistic conversational style in GenAI refers to the system&#x2019;s ability to communicate in a manner that resonates with human empathy, understanding, and natural flow, creating a more relatable and engaging user experience. Users may find themselves conversing with tone, emphasis, and emotion in a way that feels more natural, as if speaking with a human on the other end of the line (<a href="#ref3_6" id="R_ref3_6" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Browne, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref3_32" id="R_ref3_32" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Shankland, 2023</a>). In contrast to old-style AI chatbots, which were typically rule-based or with pre-programmed responses and limited in the ability to generate varied and complex responses, GenAI tools such as ChatGPT can create their own responses and outputs.</p>
<p>This opens up new possibilities for human interaction with technology, including the capability for more natural and engaging conversations with AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants. In higher education, this characteristic ensures that AI-driven platforms can facilitate supportive, intuitive, and contextually relevant interactions with users. For example, a GenAI with a humanistic conversational style might be utilised in a virtual learning environment to provide students with academic guidance. The AI, seeing the input from student stresses or inquiries, could offer supportive feedback, relevant resources, and timely advice, much like a human tutor. It would understand and process natural language inquiries, responding in a manner that is both informative and affectively resonant, thereby fostering an educational environment that is not only intellectually stimulating but also constructively supportive. This anthropomorphic interaction style has the potential to significantly enhance online learning experiences, providing students with a virtual companion that assists and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p49" aria-label=" page 49. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>understands them throughout their academic journey (<a href="#ref3_9" id="R_ref3_9" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chan &#x0026; Lee, 2023</a>). Furthermore, it encourages more organic and authentic communication, which can enhance user engagement and satisfaction. This is particularly vital in education, where student engagement is crucial for effective learning and retention. <a href="#table3_1" id="R_table3_1">Table 3.1</a> demonstrates the humanistic conversational capability and also its ability to be in a role.</p>

<td class="left">Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me! Choosing a major can be a pivotal decision and it&#x2019;s completely normal to have uncertainties about it.<p>It&#x2019;s interesting that you&#x2019;re leaning towards accounting despite feeling that you&#x2019;re not particularly good at it. This could be an opportunity to challenge yourself and enhance your skills in that area if you&#x2019;re passionate about it. However, it&#x2019;s also essential to weigh the level of commitment and interest you have in pursuing and improving in it, against the challenges that it might present.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Another feature of GenAI is its ability to handle responses effectively. With the example of ChatGPT, when faced with unclear or broad requests, it does not usually ask for clarification or indicate that it cannot provide information due to the vague nature of the question. Instead, it attempts to provide the best answer it can, offering some context in its response to help users refine their requests or prompts if necessary. This creates a smoother and more enjoyable conversational flow, bypassing the frustrating problems we may have encountered with older AI technologies that needed more information or required question rephrasing before providing any potentially valuable answers. Responses from GenAI tools can be beneficial in enhancing student learning. First, students will learn how to better articulate their questions and provide more accurate directions. Second, students often learn from these responses and gain additional information to improve their self-learning.</p></section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_3_3">
<h3 id="sec3_3_3"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.3.3 </span>Variability</h3>
<p>The variability of GenAI means that asking the same platform the same question twice does not always yield the same response. Each interaction is slightly different due to the way GenAI works, leading to varied outcomes (<a href="#ref3_35" id="R_ref3_35" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Weisz et al., 2023</a>). This may surprise some users, as computers and AI are often expected to be highly consistent. However, this variability is intentional in design, aimed at making interactions with the AI more dynamic and less deterministic.</p>
<p>Variability is like talking to different people about a given topic. Usually, if we ask the same person the same question over and over, we will get a response that is exactly the same or very similar. However, posing the same question to various people will likely elicit different responses, some slightly different, others more significantly so. However, while GenAI can produce varied responses, it is also designed to maintain a degree of consistency, particularly in providing accurate and reliable information. The variability mainly originates <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p50" aria-label=" page 50. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>from the expression of information or in the inclusion of additional context, rather than the core message or accuracy of the information provided. In other words, although responses might be formulated or phrased differently, they should all remain relevant to the input prompt.</p></section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_3_4">
<h3 id="sec3_3_4"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.3.4 </span>Multimodal Capability</h3>
<p>The multimodal capability of GenAI refers to the system&#x2019;s ability to understand, interpret, and generate content across various forms of input and output, such as text, image, voice, and even video (<a href="#ref3_15" id="R_ref3_15" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Google Cloud Blog, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref3_26" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">OpenAI, 2023</a>). This ensures a versatile and adaptive user experience as the AI is able to communicate and interact through multiple modes of interaction. In the context of higher education, this becomes profoundly impactful. For instance, a GenAI tool with multimodal capabilities can assist students in various ways: it can interpret a student&#x2019;s verbal question, analyse a related image, and provide a text-based answer (<a href="#ref3_22" id="R_ref3_22" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Lim et al., 2023</a>; <a href="#ref3_33" id="R_ref3_33" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Vartiainen &#x0026; Tedre, 2023</a>). Moreover, during virtual classes or study sessions, the AI can comprehend a spoken question, retrieve relevant textual data from educational resources, convert it into a concise summary, and then present it in an easily comprehensible visual format, such as an infographic or a short video. In research activities, it can process textual data to generate relevant visual graphs or even transform data across modalities to cater to different learning preferences and needs. The flexibility offered by multimodal GenAI ensures that learning and teaching experiences are not only rich and varied, but also widely accessible, catering to diverse learning styles and sensory preferences within the academic community. Consequently, it holds the potential to substantially elevate the efficiency and inclusiveness of educational experiences in higher learning institutions.</p></section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_3_5">
<h3 id="sec3_3_5"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.3.5 </span>Scalability</h3>
<p>GenAI text tools are scalable, meaning they can effectively handle a wide range of applications and manage varying levels of workloads, from generating short text snippets to producing longer content pieces. This adaptability allows GenAI tools to serve a varied and growing number of users, handle larger datasets, and perform more complex computations without compromising efficiency or user experience (<a href="#ref3_11" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chow, 2023</a>). In the context of higher education, scalability is essential in managing varied educational processes and serving growing student populations. For instance, a scalable GenAI tool can efficiently support a small group of users, such as a single classroom, while also possessing the capability to seamlessly meet the extensive needs of an entire university. This could involve transitioning from handling basic queries related to course content and schedules, to managing more complex and multi-faceted tasks, such as grading assignments, providing personalised feedback, or even generating adaptive learning paths for a diverse range of courses and student demographics. Moreover, as the need for research and data analysis increases, a scalable AI system could effectively process and analyse large datasets, enabling researchers and educators to derive meaningful insights, predict trends, and ultimately enhance academic decision-making. Therefore, scalability in GenAI ensures that as the educational environment evolves and expands, the technology can seamlessly and adeptly accommodate and support this growth, optimising academic and administrative functionalities.</p></section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_3_6">
<h3 id="sec3_3_6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p51" aria-label=" page 51. " role="doc-pagebreak"/><span epub:type="ordinal">3.3.6 </span>Customisability</h3>
<p>AI models like those utilised by ChatGPT, and even parts of the data on which they are trained, are available for individuals to configure, deploy, and train themselves. While the continuation of this flexibility remains to be observed as commercial realities set in, currently this capability for customisation allows AI models to be fine-tuned to specific domains or applications, potentially enhancing their performance in particular use cases.</p>
<p>GenAI can be trained on specific datasets to generate high-quality responses for a particular industry. For instance, a university could fine-tune a GenAI text model (<a href="#ref3_21" id="R_ref3_21" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Li et al., 2023</a>) to address questions related to its particular courses and programmes, facilitating easy access to information for students and thereby increasing efficiency in addressing frequently asked questions. The model may also be adapted to comprehend the university&#x2019;s policies and regulations, simplifying the information retrieval process for both students and staff. While such customisation facilitates the delivery of personalised and proficient support for academic-related tasks, it is important to note that attaining this level of customisability requires substantial effort, expertise, as well as the preparation of training and testing data and the computational resources to train and run the models in question. Thus, it can indeed be viewed as a significant challenge.</p>
<p>Customisability in GenAI underscores its potential to be tailored and adapted according to distinct user needs and preferences, ensuring that the system is not merely generically applicable, but also uniquely suitable for varied contexts and user requirements (<a href="#ref3_30" id="R_ref3_30" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Ruiz et al., 2023</a>). Users can instruct GenAI tools, such as ChatGPT, to embody specific personas &#x2013; be it a tutor, a rap singer, or a child, etc. The system can respond in these personas&#x2019; styles, text formats, or speech or image patterns. It can also identify and utilise various grammatical structures, recognise and respond to different speech patterns and styles, and even incorporate humour or sarcasm into its responses, thereby enhancing interactive and engaging user experiences across diverse scenarios, such as in the aforementioned higher education context. <a href="#table3_2" id="R_table3_2">Table 3.2</a> demonstrates the customisability in ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The characteristic of &#x2018;Coverage&#x2019;, which encompasses both the breadth and depth of content, plays a pivotal role in delivering informative and comprehensive responses across a wide range of topics in GenAI tools. Tools like ChatGPT exemplify this characteristic by offering information across a vast array of subjects. The extent to which ChatGPT can provide in-depth and detailed information depends on the robustness of the training data and the sophistication of the associated algorithms, which ensures that responses that are not only extensive, but reasonably detailed on a wide spectrum of specific topics.</p>
<p>In the context of higher education, consider a scenario wherein a student explores information regarding various academic programmes, campus facilities, or even intricate details about specific courses. ChatGPT, fortified by expansive coverage, can offer insights from general knowledge about diverse academic disciplines, to specific, in-depth details about particular courses or research areas, depending on the wealth and specificity of its training data. For instance, if a student is seeking information about biotechnology programmes, ChatGPT could provide a general overview of what biotechnology involves, and potentially delve into specifics such as genetic engineering or clinical research based on the data it has been trained on. Moreover, it can guide students on potential career paths, enlightening them about various industry sectors and research areas where a degree in biotechnology might be applicable.</p>
<p>This substantial coverage not only satisfies immediate queries but also facilitates users in conducting a structured and comprehensive exploration of topics, intertwining broad strokes with detailed insights wherever possible. However, it is crucial to note that while ChatGPT can provide a commendable extent of detail across various topics, the accuracy and specificity of information would invariably be tethered to the quality and expansiveness of its training data and the intricacy of the underlying algorithms. More information on training data is given in <a href="ch6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p></section>

<h3 id="sec3_3_8"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.3.8 </span>Contextual Relevance</h3>
<p>AI does not merely interact with us but also engages in conversations in a manner that is discerningly relevant to the given input and context. GenAI text-based tools, including ChatGPT, possess the ability to uphold a specific level of contextual understanding, which enables them to generate responses or content that aligns seamlessly with the user&#x2019;s input. In addition, they demonstrate a memory-like capability which allows for ongoing dialogue. This intricate capability extends beyond mere response generation and encapsulates recognising, comprehending, and adapting to the multi-faceted elements of interaction, such as style, tone, and content context, thereby ensuring communication that is not only syntactically accurate but also contextually congruent.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario within the higher education setting, where a student utilises a GenAI tool to seek guidance for thesis writing. The tool, equipped with contextual awareness, would not merely provide generic advice on academic writing. Instead, it would delve into thesis creation, comprehending and addressing the specificities such as research methodologies, citation styles, and potentially the subject matter of the thesis if provided by the student. If the student expresses difficulties in formulating a hypothesis for a thesis in environmental science, the AI would tailor its responses to offer guidance specifically for hypothesis creation in that domain. It might even provide suggestions grounded in environmental science, maintaining a dialogue that is contextually relevant and specifically supportive of the student&#x2019;s immediate needs.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p53" aria-label=" page 53.

This immediate feedback and hands-on approach would allow students to focus on understanding the broader concept itself, rather than getting deterred by initial hurdles. It accelerates their learning process, also fostering a more interactive and engaging classroom environment, positioning ChatGPT as a valuable teaching assistant in higher education.</p></section></section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_4">
<h2 id="sec3_4"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.4 </span>GenAI Tools and its Weaknesses and Potential Threats in Higher Education</h2>
<p>In our previous section, we highlighted numerous strengths and potential opportunities raised by text-based GenAI tools for higher education, especially in shaping curriculum design and innovative pedagogy. However, like any technology, while it can transform the way we teach and learn, there are also challenges and potential threats that must be considered. It is a classic case of &#x2018;every rose has its thorn(s)&#x2019;. In this section, our exploration turns towards understanding these challenges, using the example of ChatGPT&#x2019;s GPT-4.</p>
<p>The variability in GenAI tools poses a concern. For instance, because ChatGPT can produce different responses to the same query, verifying information for academic purposes while referring to ChatGPT as a source becomes a complex task. A student could cite a unique insight from ChatGPT in an assignment, but may not be able to reproduce the same result for later verification. Such variability can unintentionally contribute to academic discrepancies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the extensive knowledge base of ChatGPT is commendable, there is a genuine risk of information overload. The sheer volume of content it can generate has the potential to distract students from focusing on core curriculum topics, leading them down endless tangents of information. This becomes particularly problematic if students are weak in information literacy and prioritise intriguing, yet peripheral, AI-generated content over foundational curriculum concepts.</p>
<p>Academic integrity is another significant concern when it comes to the use of AI tools. The ease with which students can procure detailed answers might blur the boundaries of independent research and reliance on AI-generated content (<a href="#ref3_8" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chan &#x0026; Hu, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref3_9" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chan &#x0026; Lee, 2023</a>). Institutions will need to re-evaluate and potentially redefine what constitutes academic honesty in this AI era (<a href="#ref3_7" id="R_ref3_7" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chan, 2023</a>). It is crucial for educational institutions to establish guidelines and provide proper guidelines and education about ethical and responsible AI use to mitigate such challenge.</p>
<p>Recognising the expanding impact of AI in pedagogical methods and curriculum design, we have systematically categorised the potential weaknesses and threats posed by text-based generative AI tools. It aims to understand the implications, opportunities, and potential risks associated with the use of AI in education, providing guidelines on how the implementation of GenAI technologies in educational settings influences teaching methods, learning outcomes, student engagement, instructional design, and other relevant factors. Drawing from literature and a thorough analysis of the concerns raised by educators, students, and tech enthusiasts from our research, we segment these challenges into three main stakeholder categories that together form the framework: Students and Teachers, Educational Institutions, and Society at Large.</p>

<p>The following sections provide elaboration on each category.</p>
<p><b>Students/Teachers</b>: This category focuses on issues related to the educational process. It highlights how AI implementations could potentially change learning, impacting aspects <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p57" aria-label=" page 57. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>like cognitive development, motivation, and the whole-person development of students. Although the impacts in this category are more directly associated with students, teachers are also significantly affected as they need to adapt to these changes. The AI-induced alterations in educational dynamics require teachers to adjust their teaching methods, strategies, and interactions with both educational tools and students to ensure that the learning objectives are met effectively. This interrelated relationship between the impacts of AI on students and the corresponding adaptations made by teachers exemplifies the profound influence of AI on the educational ecosystem.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><b>Over-reliance:</b> Consistent use of AI may foster dependency. Students may become overly dependent on GenAI tools for answers, potentially stifling their own critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as diminishing their motivation for independent research and self-learning. When students become overly dependent on AI tools, they may try to use it to bypass the struggles associated with traditional learning and, more importantly, the learning process, which would likely hinder their development of crucial skills such as resilience, perseverance, and problem solving. As a result, there is a risk that students will be less prepared to tackle real-world challenges.</li>
<li><b>Accuracy Concerns:</b> AI outputs are based on data patterns rather than verified facts, and GenAI can sometimes produce information that is misleading or factually incorrect. Without human oversight, this can lead to dissemination of misinformation. While using AI tools, students may be unintentionally exposed to inaccurate or out-of-context information, leading to misunderstandings and errors which could possibly impact their own perspectives and academic performance.</li>
<li><b>Lack of Judgement:</b> AI may not capture the subtleties and nuances in learning content, affecting students&#x2019; depth of understanding. Academic discussions often involve complex perspectives and discussions. In comparison, AI tools may offer simplified answers, omitting certain details or failing to capture the richness of academic debates. Over-reliance on AI can result in a superficial grasp of intricate topics, which is counterproductive, particularly in advanced educational settings.</li>
<li><b>Loss of Personal Touch:</b> AI tools cannot replace the personal interaction, guidance, and mentorship provided by human educators. The absence of human intuition and emotional intelligence in AI-driven learning can result in a less holistic educational experience. Education is not solely about transferring knowledge; it is about mentorship, support, motivation, and personal growth. AI lacks the human touch, which can lead to an impersonal and detached learning experience. A purely AI-driven educational experience may overlook the crucial aspects of relationship-building and personal touch in teaching and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p58" aria-label=" page 58. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>learning. Interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, and the nuances of human interaction cannot be replicated by AI.</li>
<li><b>Neglection of Essential Skills:</b> AI is already capable of carrying out tasks like note taking, research, and problem solving. Traditional academic skills, including writing, analytical reasoning, and critical thinking, have long been the bedrock of higher education. However, as AI tools become more prevalent, there is a risk that students will neglect the development of these foundational skills. For instance, if an AI tool can instantly generate a research summary, students may not feel the need to go through articles and books themselves. Over time, this could lead to a generation of students who lack these essential skills, affecting their preparedness for real-world challenges and post-academic pursuits.</li>
<li><b>Homogenisation of Thought:</b> Over-reliance on AI tools can lead to a uniform way of thinking, curbing creativity and diverse perspectives in academic discussions. One of the strengths of academia is its diverse range of perspectives and debates which foster intellectual growth and the pursuit of knowledge. However, if individuals turn to the same AI tools for insights, they might end up all drawing the same conclusions, leading to a homogenised thought process. The unique interpretations and viewpoints stemming from individual research and critical thinking could thus be overshadowed. In higher education, where diverse viewpoints and critical debates are vital, AI may dampen the richness of academic discourse.</li>
<li><b>Interactivity Limits:</b> AI-driven lessons may lack the dynamism and adaptability of human-led discussions, resulting in a less interactive and potentially less engaging learning experience for students. While AI can provide structured content delivery, it may not be able to capture the spontaneity and flexibility of a human educator. Human educators can change their teaching approach on-the-fly based on students&#x2019; responses or interests, making lessons more interactive and engaging. In contrast, AI-driven lessons tend to be more static, potentially leading to reduced student engagement. This can be a particular in issue in higher education settings where discussions, debates, and interactive sessions are key components of the learning experience.</li>
<li><b>AI Overload:</b> Some students and educators, especially those who are less proficient in using technologies, may find the emergence of these AI tools intimidating. This apprehension may arise from unfamiliarity with the technology or the fear of not being able to harness its full capabilities. Consequently, rather than facilitating learning, the technology advancements could inadvertently become a hindrance. It is crucial for institutions to acknowledge such concern and provide adequate training and support to ensure a smooth transition to AI-driven teaching and learning approaches, and effective utilisation of AI tools in classrooms.</li>
<li>
<p><b>Academic Misconduct Considerations:</b> There is a fine line between offering assistance and actually doing the work. Students may be tempted to present AI-generated content as their own, giving rise to concerns about academic integrity, plagiarism, and the development of authentic skills. Using AI-generated content in assignments blurs the boundaries of academic honesty, potentially diminishing the value of original student work and questioning the legitimacy of academic qualifications.</p>
<p>Given the dynamic nature of GenAI responses, ensuring the accuracy of information becomes a challenge. Using the previous example of a student who references information from GenAI in their academic work but is unable to produce the same result later, this poses issues for source verification, which may inadvertently encourage academic dishonesty. When two students rely on a GenAI tool for assistance and receive different <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p59" aria-label=" page 59. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>answers because of the AI&#x2019;s inherent variability, it complicates matters for educators in detecting potential misuse. On the other hand, well-intentioned students may be wrongly accused of misconduct if they are unable to recreate the original AI-generated source of their information.</p></li></ul>
<p><b>Educational Institutions:</b> This category primarily focuses on operational challenges. With the constantly evolving nature of AI, educational institutions face a range of obstacles such as allocation of resources, complexities of technology integration, and inherent risks associated with utilising AI in education.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><b>Resource-Intensive:</b> Large-scale AI adoption can place significant strain on institutional resources. Setting up and maintaining advanced AI tools can be resource-intensive, potentially resulting in increased costs for institutions.</li>
<li><b>Technical Challenges:</b> Not all institutions possess the necessary infrastructure or technical expertise to implement, deploy, and maintain AI tools, thereby widening the gap between well-resourced and less-resourced institutions. This can lead to subpar implementation, software glitches, or lack of ongoing support on AI implementation, hindering the teaching and learning process for less-resourced institutions. The implementation of AI in educational settings can be full of challenges, and institutions may struggle with deployment, maintenance, and ensuring seamless integration with existing systems.</li>
<li><b>Security Risks:</b> With the adoption of AI tools, educational institutions expose themselves to new vectors of cyber threats. Implementing AI tools in higher education involves data exchanges, storage, and processing, which can create potential entry points for cyberattacks. Malicious actors may target these systems to disrupt educational processes, steal sensitive information, or execute ransomware attacks. Safeguarding against these threats require additional investments in cybersecurity measures, increasing operational complexities and costs for institutions.</li>
<li><b>Reputation Risks:</b> An educational institution&#x2019;s decision to heavily implement AI can have a negative impact on its reputation and attractiveness to prospective students. Reputation is crucial for educational institutions, and heavy reliance on AI may create a perception that the institution is cutting corners or not valuing the human aspect of education, thus diluting the educational experience. Prospective students may choose institutions that balance technological advancements with traditional teaching methods. Overall, when heavily influenced by AI, an institution&#x2019;s image and status can be impacted, with stakeholders questioning the quality of education provided and the value of degrees conferred by such institutions.</li>
<li><b>Adaptability:</b> AI tools used in education require constant updates and adjustments to align with evolving curricula, teaching methodologies, and student needs. The dynamic nature of educational methodologies and curricula, along with shifting student demographics require AI tools to be adaptable. If not, AI tools risk becoming obsolete or misaligned with institutional goals. However, the constant need for adaptation may impose strain on resources and potentially disrupt the learning process, as institutions may find themselves in a cycle of incessant updates to ensure that the AI tool remains in alignment with educational requirements and needs.</li>
<li><b>Dependency on Connectivity:</b> The effectiveness of AI tools is contingent on internet connectivity, which can render institutions more susceptible to connectivity issues. AI tools, especially cloud-based platforms, require robust internet connectivity for optimal functionality. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p60" aria-label=" page 60. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>Institutions, especially those in areas with inconsistent internet services, may encounter difficulties in ensuring the delivery of consistent education using AI. This can lead to disruptions in teaching, potentially compromising the overall learning experience. For students, unsteady connection may hinder their access to necessary resources, creating an uneven playing field.</li></ul>
<p><b>Society at Large:</b> Examining the impact of AI in education from a broader perspective, this category highlights the extensive societal implications arising from the integration of AI in education. Issues related to ethics, equity, and the economy that extend beyond the confines of individual classrooms and institutions are central to this segment.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p><b>Bias:</b> AI&#x2019;s effectiveness is heavily reliant on the data it is trained with (<a href="#ref3_3" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Arora et al., 2023</a>; <a href="#ref3_8" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chan &#x0026; Hu, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref3_14" id="R_ref3_14" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Ferrara, 2023</a>). If biases exist in their training datasets, AI outputs could mirror these biases, offering skewed perspectives that may mislead or misinform students. AI models may also unintentionally reinforce such biases, resulting in unbalanced educational content that could either bolster stereotypes or omit certain viewpoints. It is also worth noting that while GenAI tools such as ChatGPT have been trained to decline inappropriate requests, it is still possible for it to make mistakes or generate responses that are not aligned with these guidelines for appropriate use. As a result, it is important for users and developers to monitor the outputs of AI tools and to provide additional training, or adjust the system as needed to ensure that it continues to generate appropriate responses. According to a Bloomberg article (<a href="#ref3_25" id="R_ref3_25" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Nicoletti &#x0026; Bass, 2023</a>), text-to-image GenAI models such as Stable Diffusion can amplify stereotypes on race and gender, surpassing the levels observed in reality. Through an analysis of over 5,000 images generated by Stable Diffusion, the article illustrated how the model intensifies racial and gender imbalances, emphasising that the widespread use of GenAI tools not only perpetuates existing stereotypes, hindering progress towards achieving more equitable representation, but also poses a risk of unjust practices. For example, utilising a biased text-to-image AI for generating sketches of suspected criminals could potentially lead to wrongful convictions.</p>
<p>The training of GenAI significantly relies on the quality and diversity of the data it is trained on. However, sourcing training data predominantly from online platforms introduces inherent biases. One notable bias arises from the digital divide, where certain populations such as older individuals or those in technologically underserved regions are underrepresented due to limited computer usage or online presence. This lack of representation may lead to AI having a skewed understanding of human demographics and preferences. Additionally, the dominance of the English language in online data introduces another inherent biases in AI systems. Many AI models are trained on datasets where English is overrepresented, which can marginalise non-English speakers and overlook the cultural and linguistic diversity of other languages and dialects. Moreover, the cultural bias is evident as Western cultures tend to be more represented in online data compared to Asian or other non-Western cultures. This cultural bias can further perpetuate stereotypes and misrepresentations.</p>
<p>Other factors contributing to biased training data include socio-economic bias, as individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds may have unequal levels of online presence or representation in digital data. The limited representation of individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds and resulting potential bias in AI models means that the latter will fail to accurately reflect the needs and experiences of these communities, even deepening existing disparities and inequalities.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p61" aria-label=" page 61. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>Political bias is another concern &#x2013; that AI may reflect skewed political ideologies based on the sources of its training data. If the data predominantly comes from politically biased sources, the AI system may mirror them, resulting in problematic outcomes especially in contexts requiring neutrality and balanced perspectives. An article by <a href="#ref3_1002" id="R_ref3_1002" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Rozado (2023)</a> discussed the potential for political biases in large language models (LLMs) and the concerns surrounding their misuse. It shared findings from a study where 15 different political orientation tests were administered to ChatGPT. The results were significant, with 14 out of the 15 tests indicating that ChatGPT&#x2019;s responses inclined towards left-leaning viewpoints. The article suggests that for ethical AI practices, systems should provide users with balanced arguments regarding the matter discussed, and refrain from claiming neutrality while displaying evident political bias in their content.</p>
<p>Moreover, biases can emerge from the attitudes and prejudices of human annotators who label the training data, as well as from the AI systems&#x2019; design, such as feature selection and model structure. <a href="#table3_7" id="R_table3_7">Table 3.7</a> summarises the biases in training data for GenAI.</p>

<p>These biases all contribute to problematic concerns including:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Ethical concerns: Certain types of inappropriate requests, such as those promoting hate speech or violence, raise serious ethical concerns. Such requests have the potential to harm individuals and communities and can contribute to a hostile or toxic environment.</li>
<li>Legal implications: Certain types of inappropriate requests, such as those that solicit personal information or contain illegal content, may have legal implications, thus, it is crucial that the tools are not used to facilitate illegal activity or violate privacy laws.</li>
<li>Reputation and trust: Systems that generate inappropriate responses can damage their reputation and erode trust with users. For example, a customer service chatbot that generates offensive or inappropriate responses could harm the reputation of the company it represents and lead to a loss of trust among customers.</li>
<li>Responsibility and accountability: As artificial intelligence systems become more integrated into society, it is important to consider who is responsible and accountable for their actions. This includes ensuring that such systems are not used to facilitate inappropriate behaviour or harm individuals and communities.</li></ul>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p62" aria-label=" page 62. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>As such, it is crucial to strive for a more equitable and inclusive approach in sourcing, annotating, and structuring the data used to train GenAI model.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><b>Data Privacy Concerns:</b> The use of AI in education often requires collecting and processing personal and sensitive information, raising concerns about privacy and data security. Students and educators may be sharing academic and personal data with AI platforms, and without stringent data protection measures, there is a risk of data breaches or misuse which compromises individual privacy. It is crucial to recognise the potential risk of data breaches that could jeopardise privacy and security, and to implement measures to safeguard sensitive and personal data.</li>
<li><b>Economic Implications:</b> The financial implications of adopting AI, in terms of both costs and potential job displacements in the education sector, require careful consideration. Adopting AI tools can be a significant financial investment for institutions. While there is potential for long-term cost savings, the initial expenditure and ongoing maintenance costs can strain budgets. Moreover, the increased reliance on AI may lead to reduced demands for certain job roles within the educational ecosystem, potentially resulting in job losses. In addition, it is important to consider the broader economic impact on the community, especially if an institution is a significant employer. However, according to one of our recent studies (<a href="#ref3_10" id="R_ref3_10" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chan &#x0026; Tsi, 2023</a>), students still have a strong preference for human teachers over artificial ones as they believe that human teachers possess unique characteristics that machines cannot replicate. In <a href="ch7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, we will further discuss the implications of AI on the job market.</li>
<li><b>Inequitable Access:</b> While AI has the potential to democratise education, its implementation can inadvertently widen the educational divide, where, based on resource availability, the introduction of advanced AI tools can lead to access disparities in quality education. Institutions with more resources may offer AI-enhanced education, while others lag behind (<a href="#ref3_17" id="R_ref3_17" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Holstein &#x0026; Doroudi, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref3_28" id="R_ref3_28" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Pedro et al., 2019</a>). Students without access to AI tools might be at a disadvantage, leading to a widened gap in educational outcomes. In a global context, this disparity may manifest between urban and rural areas, or between developed and developing nations.</li>
<li><b>Over-commercialisation:</b> The rise of AI in education may attract numerous businesses, leading to potential conflicts between commercial interests and genuine educational needs: there is potential for an influx of companies offering AI solutions, and while competition can drive innovation, there is also a risk of commercial interests infringing upon educational goals. Institutions could be lured by aggressive marketing tactics or exclusive deals, potentially side-lining the learning needs of their students. The commodification of education would overall dilute its intrinsic value.</li></ul>
<p>With the above categories, stakeholders can gain a better understanding of the potential challenges in integrating AI in the educational sector and addresses potential issues. This ensures that AI-partnered education is both thoughtful and inclusive, catering to all stakeholders involved.</p>
<p>While text-based GenAI tools like ChatGPT are undeniably revolutionising pedagogy in higher education, it is crucial to approach their integration with caution. Striking a balance between utilising tools to their strengths and being mindful of potential challenges will be crucial in harnessing their full potential while upholding the fundamental values of academic learning. <a href="#table3_8" id="R_table3_8">Table 3.8</a> shows a comprehensive overview of the strengths and weaknesses of GenAI in higher education.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p63" aria-label=" page 63.

<h3 id="sec3_5_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.5.1 </span>Literary Study of ChatGPT&#x2019;s GPT-4 via Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy</h3>
<p>Understanding the capabilities of GenAI to process, analyse, and generate textual information is important for its comparison and possible integration with established educational frameworks, including Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy&#x2019;s Cognitive Domain model. Using OpenAI&#x2019;s ChatGPT GPT-4, this study investigates the intersection between ChatGPT&#x2019;s capabilities and the six cognitive processes outlined in Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy (i.e., remembering, understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating, and creating). The study aims to examine the depth and breadth of AI&#x2019;s utility in literary and textual analyses, as well as identify potential implications for pedagogy and curriculum development in higher education. The study is currently under review. The primary research question is:</p>

<p>This study incorporates a variety of literary genres, including novels, poems, articles, and plays, to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. The methodology is iterative: ChatGPT will be prompted to engage with each literary text in accordance with the six cognitive processes, and its responses will be meticulously analysed by five researchers to assess their depth, accuracy, and relevance. <a href="#table3_10" id="R_table3_10">Table 3.10</a> shows the rubric for assessing ChatGPT&#x2019;s responses at the &#x201C;remembering&#x201D; level of Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy with three criteria &#x2013; the depth of response, accuracy of response, and relevance of response. This systematic approach sheds light on ChatGPT&#x2019;s text generation capabilities in literary analysis and its potential for pedagogical applications. (Note: for the actual study, six distinct rubrics, each corresponding to the six levels of Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy, were used to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment and offer detailed analyses of the model&#x2019;s performance across different cognitive levels).</p>

<td class="left">Of course! Let&#x2019;s use &#x201C;Oliver Twist&#x201D; by Charles Dickens as our case study to illustrate ChatGPT-4&#x2019;s capabilities across the six levels of Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy Cognitive Domain model.
<ol type="1">
<li>Remembering: ChatGPT-4&#x2019;s Capability &#x2013; recall specific details, facts, information, and data.
<p>Oliver Twist is an orphan who begins his life in a workhouse. He later escapes and has several adventures in London, encountering characters like Fagin, the Artful Dodger, and Bill Sikes.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Understanding: ChatGPT-4&#x2019;s Capability &#x2013; Comprehend the meaning, interpretation, and descriptions.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oliver Twist&#x201D; delves into the hardships of the orphaned and the poor during Victorian England. It underscores the societal disparities and highlights the ease with which innocence can be corrupted in the midst of adversity.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Applying: ChatGPT-4&#x2019;s Capability &#x2013; Use the knowledge in new ways or situations.</p>
<p>Dickens&#x2019; portrayal of Oliver&#x2019;s journey can be juxtaposed against modern-day situations, like the challenges faced by migrants or refugees. Despite the historical setting, the themes of exploitation and survival are universally relevant.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Analysing: ChatGPT-4&#x2019;s Capability &#x2013; Distinguish different parts, understand their interrelationships.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oliver Twist&#x201D; is structured around both Oliver&#x2019;s personal journey and the societal context around him. Characters such as Fagin represent the criminal underbelly of society, whereas others like Mr. Brownlow showcase benevolence and kindness. The contrast in characters is Dickens&#x2019; method of exploring societal morality.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Evaluating: ChatGPT-4&#x2019;s Capability &#x2013; Justify and defend opinions and decisions.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oliver Twist&#x201D; is not just a narrative but a social commentary. Dickens&#x2019; vivid portrayal of workhouses and the plight of the orphans stands as a critique of the Victorian era&#x2019;s treatment of the underprivileged. One could argue that Dickens uses Oliver&#x2019;s story as an instrument to highlight the societal flaws and demand change.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Creating: ChatGPT-4&#x2019;s Capability &#x2013; Build new structures or patterns from diverse elements.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Drawing from the narrative, one could conceive a modern adaptation, perhaps set in a 21st-century urban backdrop. This retelling might focus on contemporary social issues while retaining the essence of Oliver&#x2019;s trials and tribulations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, ChatGPT-4 can indeed navigate all six levels of Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy when analysing &#x201C;Oliver Twist&#x201D;. While its analysis and evaluations are rooted in vast amounts of textual data and patterns, the absence of personal emotions or biases ensures a consistent and objective approach to literary analysis.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></section>

<h2 id="sec3_6"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.6 </span>Redesigning Pedagogical Activities with GenAI</h2>
<p>The role of technology as both a tool and a partner in higher education continues to be redefined. Throughout this chapter, we have set our sights on illustrating the promising partnership between AI, pedagogy and us, with a spotlight on ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Having examined the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of GenAI and ChatGPT in previous sections, we have established a foundational understanding of the potentials and pitfalls. Building on this, our research study, &#x201C;AI-Partnered Pedagogy through the Lens of Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy&#x201D; has also exemplified how AI&#x2019;s capabilities can align with, and enhance, cognitive skills across the learning spectrum.</p>
<p>GenAI can be a revolutionary tool for curriculum design especially in higher education, infusing a dynamic and responsive element into educational content creation and interaction. For instance, educators can use GenAI tools to generate illustrative examples, create engaging content, or formulate quizzes that align with specific learning objectives. Furthermore, GenAI models can be utilised to automate responses to frequently asked questions from students, providing instant support. In higher education, where the curriculum often includes a blend of foundational and advanced, specialised knowledge, GenAI tools can assist in delivering content that caters to all levels of learners.</p>
<p>Consider a case where university professors are designing a course on artificial intelligence. They could utilise GenAI tools to generate introductory content, providing students with an accessible entry point into complex concepts like machine learning algorithms or neural networks. Additionally, the educators could also use GenAI to come up with diverse and complex problems and tasks, enabling students to apply their knowledge in varied scenarios to gain the most out of the course.</p>
<p>In another case, GenAI could be utilised as an interactive study assistant, where students engage in dialogue with the tool, exploring topics, clarifying their misunderstandings, and receiving responses instantly. For example, a student working on a research project about bioinformatics could utilise GenAI to better understand complex genetic algorithms or to curate information about the latest advancements in the field. This interactivity not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p69" aria-label=" page 69. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>only supports students in their learning, but also makes the process more engaging and tailored to their own needs. Overall, this helps to foster a more inclusive and supportive educational environment.</p>
<p>GenAI tools, with its multi-faceted functionalities and adaptable nature, provides educators and students in higher education with great versatility. It has the capability to enhance educational content, facilitate dynamic learning experiences, and cultivate an environment wherein information is more accessible, interactive, and tailored for diverse learning needs and objectives.</p>
<p>This brings us to the crux of this section: How can GenAI assist in enhancing student learning in higher education? After extensively reviewing literature, online blogs, discussion forums, as well as discussions with students and teachers, we have consolidated numerous ideas for integrating GenAI into pedagogy. Below, we will provide a list of examples for how GenAI, primarily ChatGPT, can be utilised in pedagogical designs within higher education. A list, which can be found in <a href="#table3_13" id="R_table3_13">Table 3.13</a>, aligns with ChatGPT&#x2019;s functions and serves as a guide for educators, learners, researchers, and administrators. This practical roadmap highlights the ways in which GenAI can be harnessed in the classroom and beyond. With some of your own creativity, readers can also add elements from their personal experiences and insights to these ideas in crafting innovative, AI&#x2013;human collaborative pedagogies.</p>

<li><b>Scenario Overview</b>: In an introductory philosophy course, a professor seeks ways to enhance student interaction and engagement outside of the traditional classroom setting. She is especially keen on using technology to facilitate deep reflections and debates on philosophical topics.</li>
<li><b>Challenge</b>: Philosophy is not just about understanding various philosophical stances, but also about engaging in discussions, formulating one&#x2019;s perspective, and refining it based on counterarguments. Traditional lectures primarily involve reading and writing from which dynamic interactions essential to truly internalise philosophical debates are lacking.</li>
<li><b>Suggestion</b>: Implementing ChatGPT as a Debate Partner for Interactive Classwork</li>
<li><b>Curriculum Design</b>: Each week, students are presented with a philosophical stance (e.g., Utilitarianism). Their task is to have a debate with ChatGPT on the merits and demerits of the stance.</li>
<li><b>Procedures</b>:
<ul class="disc">
<li>Outside of class hours, students initiate a conversation with ChatGPT using its speech recognition and voice capabilities, stating their position and assigning a role for ChatGPT. They then engage in a debate, trying to defend their stance while ChatGPT offers counterarguments or plays devil&#x2019;s advocate.</li>
<li>Post-debate, students submit a reflective essay on their discussion with ChatGPT in which they document their learnings, and identify strengths and areas for improvement.</li>
<li>Students submit their chat logs, which are captured by ChatGPT transcripts, along with their reflections.</li>
<li>In the following class, students are grouped together and given the opportunity to review and analyse each other&#x2019;s debates and reflections. This group review process adds an additional layer of interaction and learning as students can gain insights from their peers&#x2019; perspectives, engage in constructive feedback, and further deepen their understanding of the philosophical stances discussed.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy Alignment</b>:
<ul class="disc">
<li><b>Analysing</b>: By dissecting their own arguments as well as those generated by ChatGPT, students distinguish between facts and assumptions. The analysis enhances their understanding of the complexities of philosophical reasoning.</li>
<li><b>Evaluating</b>: Throughout the debate, students make judgements on the validity of the arguments put forth by both themselves and ChatGPT. Their reflections are a direct evaluation of their performance.</li>
<li><b>Creating</b>: The entire debate is an exercise in creating arguments and counterarguments, also refining thought processes based on the interaction with ChatGPT.</li></ul></li>

A glance at job ads with eye-catching salaries for prompt engineers, and articles from <i>Forbes</i> (<a href="#ref3_12" id="R_ref3_12" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Cook, 2023</a>) and <i>Time</i> (<a href="#ref3_29" id="R_ref3_29" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Popli, 2023</a>), shows the escalating demand and significance of this role. However, what exactly is prompt engineering and why is it important? Prompt engineering is the bridge between human language and machine understanding, ensuring smooth, intuitive interactions between the two. This section discusses the art and science of prompt engineering, explaining its necessity and the strategies involved in designing effective prompts to converse with GenAI.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_8_1">
<h3 id="sec3_8_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.8.1 </span>The Essence of Prompts</h3>
<p>At the heart of our interactions with GenAI tools, especially with language processing models, are prompts. They serve as cues or instructions, guiding the GenAI system to generate relevant outputs. Whether it is asking Siri to set a reminder or Bing Chat to retrieve information, prompts are how we start our conversations with GenAI. The effectiveness of such interactions greatly depends on how well we craft our prompts. Better prompts not only enhance our experience with AI, but also optimise the model&#x2019;s performance, making AI more useful and efficient as a tool in our daily lives.</p>
<p>The importance of prompt engineering is crucial for a multitude of AI utilisations, making it an essential skill. It can help with debugging, tweaking AI models, and ensuring resource efficiency &#x2013; for example, when our prompts are more detailed and accurate, the model will be able to generate desired outputs more quickly and efficiently, using less computational resources overall. In a world where AI&#x2013;human collaborations will become <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p81" aria-label=" page 81. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>increasingly prevalent, mastering prompt engineering will be a technical requirement as well as a pathway to making AI more intuitive and better aligned with human expectations. It is a skill key to our future-readiness.</p></section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_8_2">
<h3 id="sec3_8_2"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.8.2 </span>The Prompt Engineering Components</h3>
<p>The design of effective prompts doesn&#x2019;t have a &#x2018;one-size-fits-all&#x2019; formula. Instead, we must understand the Prompt Engineering Components and apply them sensibly. Below we include seven useful Components &#x2013; Instruction, Context, Role, Succinctness, Example, Format, and Readjustment, as shown in <a href="#fig3_4" id="R_fig3_4">Figure 3.4</a>. For readers to practice applying these, we provide a &#x2018;Try-It Prompt&#x2019; at the end of each component description below. Using the example of &#x201C;Constructivism in Education&#x201D;, these example prompts provide a concrete context to understand how the &#x201C;Prompt Engineering Components&#x201D; can be used.</p>
<figure id="fig3_4"><img src="images/fig3_4_B.jpg" alt="Prompt engineering components include instruction, context, role, succinctness, example, format, and adjustment."/>
<figcaption><a href="#R_fig3_4" epub:type="backlink" role="doc-backlink" aria-label=" This link returns to its first in-text citation. "><span epub:type="label">Figure</span> <span epub:type="ordinal">3.4 </span>The Prompt Engineering Components.</a></figcaption></figure>
<ul class="simple">
<li><b>Instruction:</b> The instruction component is the foundation of a prompt, providing the AI with a clear directive on what it should generate or provide. It is akin to asking a precise question to obtain a precise answer. The clarity of instruction helps steer the AI towards the desired output, ensuring the responses are aligned with, and relevant to, the user&#x2019;s expectations. For example, in higher education, instructing an AI to summarise a research article sets a clear task for it to execute.</li>
<li><b>Try-It Prompt:</b> Explain the concept of Constructivism in Education.</li>
<li><b>Context:</b> Context provides additional information that helps the AI understand the situation or background against which the instruction is being given. Including context can lead to more informed and nuanced responses, helping users eliminate ambiguity, and further ensure that the AI&#x2019;s response is relevant and accurate. For instance, specifying the topic and time frame in a request for summarising a research article helps the AI to focus its response accordingly.</li>
<li><b>Try-It Prompt:</b> Explain the concept of Constructivism in Education, focusing on its impact and implications for online learning.</li>
<li><b><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p82" aria-label=" page 82. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>Role:</b> The role component allows the user to specify a persona or capacity in which they want the AI to respond. This could be particularly useful in educational settings where the tone or perspectives of a response could vary, based on the assigned role. For example, instructing the AI to assume the role of an academic advisor could generate a response that is professional and supportive, whereas asking it to assume the role of a student mentor may generate one that is more friendly and casual.</li>
<li><b>Try-It Prompt:</b> Please take on the role of a university professor and explain the concept of Constructivism in Education, focusing on its impact and implications for online learning.</li>
<li><b>Succinctness:</b> Succinctness is the importance of conciseness and clarity in crafting prompts. A well-structured, concise prompt is easier for the AI to interpret and accurately respond to. It is about striking a balance between providing enough information and not confusing the AI with excessive details, thereby enabling more efficient communication.</li>
<li><b>Try-It Prompt:</b> As a university professor, explain Constructivism in Education and its impact and implications for online learning, focusing only on how it influences course design.</li>
<li><b>Example:</b> Providing an example within a prompt serves to clarify or further illustrate the instruction(s), helping the AI to better understand the task at hand. Examples can be especially helpful in complex or ambiguous requests, offering a reference point for the AI to gauge the kind of response expected by the user.</li>
<li><b>Try-It Prompt:</b> As a university professor, explain Constructivism in Education and its impact and implications for online learning, focusing on how it might influence course design. For example, discuss how a constructivist approach would encourage students to interact and build knowledge through discussions in online forums.</li>
<li><b>Format:</b> The format component specifies the desired structure of the AI&#x2019;s response, be it in paragraphs, bullet points, tables, etc. Specifying a format helps in obtaining responses that are easy to read, understand, and utilise, especially in educational or research contexts where the organisation of the information and data presentation are important.</li>
<li><b>Try-It Prompt:</b> As a university professor, provide a bullet-point summary of Constructivism in Education and its impact and implications for online learning, particularly for course design. Categorise the bullet points into subthemes.</li>
<li><b>Adjustment</b>: Adjustment is the process of refining the prompt based on previous responses from the AI. It is about tweaking the prompt to enhance clarity, add missing details, or correct misunderstandings, in order to generate a better, more accurate output. This component is an iterative approach to prompt engineering, facilitating a learning loop between the user and the AI.</li>
<li><b>Try-It Prompt:</b> As a university professor, provide a detailed explanation of Constructivism in Education, its historical evolution in Asia, and its implications for online course design, in a bullet-point format.</li></ul>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3_8_2_1">
<h4 id="sec3_8_2_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.8.2.1 </span>Other Prompting Techniques</h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><b>Zero-shot learning:</b> Zero-shot learning refers to when an AI model is expected to perform tasks for which it has not been previously given training data on. It is about leveraging the model&#x2019;s existing knowledge to interpret and respond to new, unseen prompts. In prompt engineering, this strategy can be crucial for exploring the AI model&#x2019;s ability to generalise and provide meaningful responses to novel requests.</li>
<li><b>Few-shot learning:</b> Few-shot learning involves providing a small number of examples to guide the AI model in understanding a new task. Unlike zero-shot learning, here, the model has a few reference points to base its responses on. In prompt engineering, this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p83" aria-label=" page 83. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>strategy helps to fine-tune the model&#x2019;s responses by providing some context through a few examples, allowing it to better align with the user&#x2019;s expectations for the outputs.</li>
<li><b>Chain of Thought:</b> The Chain of Thought strategy involves crafting a series of logically connected prompts that build upon each other, developing a more coherent and in-depth conversation with the AI model. Through facilitating dialogue that has a continuous and logical flow, this enables more engaging and insightful interactions with AI.</li>
<li><b>Negative and Positive Prompting:</b> Negative and Positive Prompting involves specifying what you do and do <i>not</i> want in the AI&#x2019;s output. Positive prompting specifies which certain elements to include, while negative prompting specifies which to exclude. This strategy is important for structuring and refining the AI&#x2019;s responses in accordance with the user&#x2019;s expectations.</li></ul>
<p>Each of these prompt engineering components and techniques offers specifications with which we can craft and refine our prompts, enhancing the effectiveness and utility of our interactions with AI, especially in more complex domains. We will have to think carefully about which components we select and combine for use; with practice, one can master the skills of prompt engineering, making their AI interactions more efficient, engaging, and productive.</p>
<p>The world of prompt engineering is as vast as it is thought-provoking. It is about crafting a language that resonates with machines, making our conversations with AI not just meaningful but also enjoyable. Whether as an AI enthusiast, researcher, or someone just curious about the emergence of an AI&#x2013;human future, understanding prompt engineering will bring us all a step closer to better human-and-machine collaboration, where we converse, work, and innovate together with these tools and technologies.</p></section></section></section>
<section epub:type="conclusion" role="doc-conclusion">
<h2 id="sec3_9"><span epub:type="ordinal">3.9 </span>Conclusions</h2>
<p>This chapter has been an enlightening exploration into the nexus of GenAI and pedagogy. It illustrated a range of potentials, challenges, and intricacies of integrating advanced tools like ChatGPT into our educational systems. Through our discussions, we have also established that while AI is a powerful tool, it is not perfect. Its effectiveness relies on our ability to utilise its capabilities correctly, understanding its strengths and limitations.</p>
<p>Our exploration in the &#x201C;Literary Study of ChatGPT&#x2019;s GPT-4 via Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy&#x201D; further showcased AI&#x2019;s capabilities. Focusing on Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy, we looked at how ChatGPT can demonstrate different levels of cognitive processes, from remembering and recalling information to the more complex level of creation. The intersection of AI and established educational frameworks explored AI&#x2019;s role in literary and textual analyses, offering novel approaches for curriculum development and educational research in higher education.</p>
<p>The conversation around AI in education often revolves around its efficacy or efficiency, but its true potential is in its capacity to revolutionise. It promises not just automation but augmentation; with AI, we can better foster an environment where rote learning gives way to creative synthesis, and where students are not mere recipients but active constructors of knowledge.</p>
<p>Yet, as we stand on this precipice of transformation, introspection is crucial. The appeal of AI is undeniable, but its integration into pedagogy demands a judicious balance. We must be wary of viewing it as a panacea, for the essence of education lies in the human touch &#x2013; the spark of curiosity, the thrill of discovery, and the warmth of mentorship. AI, in its most potent form, should serve to amplify these experiences, not replace them.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p84" aria-label=" page 84. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>As we look to the future, the development of relevant frameworks and ongoing research will be vital milestones to ensure that AI&#x2019;s role in education grows, and does so in a way that meaningfully enriches the learning experience for all. As we close this chapter, let it be a call to educators, technologists, and learners to together co-construct an educational paradigm that not only integrates AI into teaching and learning, but is also inspired by it.</p>
<aside epub:type="tip" role="doc-tip" class="box ruled">
<h3 id="box3_5">Questions to Ponder</h3>
<ul class="disc">
<li>How can educators ensure that the AI tools they incorporate into teaching and learning, align with their curriculum&#x2019;s objectives and values?</li>
<li>Is it possible that with the integration of ChatGPT technology, certain undergraduate programmes may become less relevant and result in challenges for students when looking for employment opportunities?</li>
<li>As the use of AI tools becomes more commonplace in education, how can we prepare students to critically engage with and evaluate the information they obtain from such tools?</li>
<li>How can we measure the long-term impact of AI-integrated curriculums on student learning outcomes and the overall educational quality?</li></ul></aside>
<aside epub:type="tip" role="doc-tip" class="box shaded">
<h3 id="box3_6">Personal Reflection</h3>
<p>From our studies, ChatGPT can provide responses that go beyond the recall (remembering) level of Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy, and appears to be capable of attaining levels further up in the hierarchy &#x2013; even the level of creating. Of course, currently, it does require human prompting and does not produce these responses autonomously; it often requires a number of steps (sophisticated, concise, and articulate prompts) before achieving these higher cognitive levels. It makes us wonder if GenAI tools really have &#x201C;intelligence&#x201D;? (Though it is not for this book to answer, I must admit it gets us all thinking.) In a later chapter, we will discuss how large language models generate text; maybe after learning more, you can draw your own conclusions.</p></aside></section>
