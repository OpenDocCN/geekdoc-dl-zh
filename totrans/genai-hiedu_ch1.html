<h2 id="sec1_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">1.1 </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has disrupted many industries and, likewise, has the potential to revolutionise the field of education. One tool that has been making waves in this regard is the <i>Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer</i> &#x2013; best known as ChatGPT, a pretrained language processing model developed by OpenAI. In this chapter, we will first introduce the concepts of AI, Big Data, IoT and Generative AI (GenAI) to offer our readers a basic understanding of these technologies, providing some concrete examples from educational settings. To equip readers with the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions on incorporating AI into the classroom, this chapter will also go over some fundamental technical aspects of AI. We will then delve into why ChatGPT is a game changer for higher education, what the tool is capable of, and why it has suddenly gained such significant attention. This chapter will conclude with questions that we may have regarding the application of AI and ChatGPT in education.</p></section>

<h2 id="sec1_2"><span epub:type="ordinal">1.2 </span>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
<p>When thinking about AI, we might immediately associate it with science fiction and shiny robots; in fact, however, the science of AI has been around for decades. As per the term <i>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</i> itself, it is a man-made system of computer-based algorithms and programmes that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. We can find it in software programmes that we use in our everyday lives, from platforms like YouTube, Amazon and Taobao, Meta (Facebook), Google Translate, Google Maps, Microsoft Bing and more. These &#x201C;intelligences&#x201D; are built into such systems that have capabilities in image processing, speech recognition, decision-making, language translation, and even artificial creativity.</p>
<p>AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. AI involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on said data. Advancements in electronics and computing hardware over recent years have allowed for huge leaps in the development of AI, enabling faster computing power, increased data and memory storage, and the creation of new algorithms such as deep learning.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since its inception in the 1950s. According to researchers and AI philosophers, AI has already gone through significant change and expansion (e.g., <a href="#ref1_11" id="R_ref1_11" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Cordeschi, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref1_53" id="R_ref1_53" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Shao et al., 2022</a>), with new advancements continually building upon prior developments to produce increasingly sophisticated systems. Currently, discourse has identified three broad categories of AI, based on the complexity and extent of machine intelligence: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). <a href="#fig1_1" id="R_fig1_1">Figure 1.1</a> shows the types of AI. While these can be considered as the evolutionary stages of AI, it should be noted that AGI and ASI are still theoretical concepts and not necessarily achieved through linear progression.</p>
<figure id="fig1_1"><img src="images/fig1_1_B.jpg" alt="The three types of artificial intelligence are artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and artificial super intelligence."/>

<p><b>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</b> refers to systems that are designed to perform specific tasks and are trained on large datasets to execute the tasks with precision, such as playing chess or translating languages. However, they are not capable of performing tasks that require human-level intelligence. ANI has helped us make numerous breakthroughs in society, such as in the domains of speech recognition and object recognition or detection (<a href="#ref1_29" id="R_ref1_29" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">LeCun et al., 2015</a>). Siri, Alexa, fraud detection systems which analyse financial data for patterns and anomalies, as well as self-driving cars that use data from sensors, cameras and GPS to control vehicles, are all examples of ANI. These systems are often referred to as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p3" aria-label=" page 3. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>&#x201C;weak AI&#x201D; (<a href="#ref1_57" id="R_ref1_57" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Thierer et al., 2017</a>) as they have limited capabilities and lack general &#x2018;intelligence&#x2019; due to being optimised for narrowly-defined tasks.</p>
<p><b>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</b> refers to machine systems that will become capable of performing any intellectual task that humans are capable of. AGI refers to a hypothetical future stage of AI which &#x201C;[bridges] the gap between current AI programs, which are narrow in scope, and the types of AGI systems commonly seen in fiction&#x201D; (<a href="#ref1_17" id="R_ref1_17" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Goertzel, 2014</a>, p.2). Unlike ANI, AGI systems will possess the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that we can. It will also have the ability to reason. Such systems would have a more general-purpose intelligence and not be restricted to a specific task. AGI is considered the next step in the evolution of AI and is often referred to as &#x201C;strong AI&#x201D; (<a href="#ref1_41" id="R_ref1_41" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Mills, 2018</a>). According to research and news articles, AI research labs and companies have not reached this stage of development (<a href="#ref1_7" id="R_ref1_7" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Baum &#x0026; Villasenor, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref1_9" id="R_ref1_9" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Bove, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref1_15" id="R_ref1_15" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Gillani, 2023</a>), but AGI is the goal of many researchers in the field of AI. An example of AGI could be a tool that is able to initiate and perform a wide range of tasks such as a teaching software that can assign classwork, devise schedules for students, correct classwork, coordinate with administrative staff, community partners, and other students, and adapt to new situations, all without the need for human intervention or reprogramming.</p>
<p><b>Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)</b> is the final conceptualised type of AI evolution (<a href="#ref1_60" id="R_ref1_60" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Yampolskiy, 2016</a>), where systems would surpass human intelligence in every possible aspect and possess the ability to outsmart us in all tasks, including higher-order thinking skills such as creativity, general knowledge, and problem solving. Some believe that ASI systems would have the ability to solve complex problems, make decisions, and even possess consciousness and emotions (e.g., <a href="#ref1_6" id="R_ref1_6" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Barney, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref1_34" id="R_ref1_34" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Marri, 2018</a>). This type of sophistication is sometimes referred to as &#x201C;AI singularity&#x201D; (<a href="#ref1_18" id="R_ref1_18" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Grossman, 2023</a>). The term &#x201C;singularity&#x201D; in this context is borrowed from the field of physics, where it is used to describe a point in space-time where the rules, as we understand them, break down, such as at the centre of a black hole. In the context of AI, the singularity would represent a point where machines become so advanced that human minds can no longer predict or understand the former&#x2019;s behaviour or implications. This could include AI improving its design and creating successive generations of increasingly powerful machines. This type of AI is still purely speculative, and the exact timeline for its development is unknown. However, the development of ASI and its impact on society raises many ethical and moral questions. ASI is often portrayed as a potential threat to humanity, and there are debates about how to ensure its safe development and deployment (<a href="#ref1_8" id="R_ref1_8" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Bostrom, 2014</a>; <a href="#ref1_61" id="R_ref1_61" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Yudkowsky, 2006</a>). When contemplating ASI, it is often associated with fictional depictions such as Skynet in <i>The Terminator</i>, Vision from the <i>Marvel</i> franchise, or the AI robot (Sonny) in <i>I, Robot</i>.</p>
<p>Currently, we are still in the stage of ANI, where our systems are designed to perform specific tasks, whereas AGI and ASI remain as areas of continued research and speculation. The potential for future advancements is immense, and the impact that AI will have on society continues to be the subject of research and debate.</p></section></section>

<p>The growth of Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) has created a platform in which AI can be applied in a wide range of industries and applications, from healthcare and finance to retail and transportation. The progress of Big Data and IoT also greatly impacts how we live, enabling greater convenience and efficiency, in turn leading to improved productivity and enhanced quality of life.</p>

<h3 id="sec1_3_1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p4" aria-label=" page 4. " role="doc-pagebreak"/><span epub:type="ordinal">1.3.1 </span>What Is Big Data?</h3>
<p>You may have heard of the term &#x201C;Big Data&#x201D;. As indicated by its name, Big Data refers to a vast amount of data (<a href="#ref1_14" id="R_ref1_14" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Favaretto et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref1_25" id="R_ref1_25" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kitchin &#x0026; McArdle, 2016</a>), but did you know that data can come in various forms, such as text, numbers, images, audio recordings, and videos?</p>
<p>Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that are too complex and voluminous for traditional data processing systems to handle efficiently (<a href="#ref1_37" id="R_ref1_37" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">McAfee &#x0026; Brynjolfsson, 2012</a>). They can be structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data generated or retrieved from various sources, including social media, e-commerce platforms, sensors, government data, financial data, telecommunication and gaming industries, and system and software logs. Structured data is information that is organised in a specific and predefined format, such as tables, spreadsheets, and databases (<a href="#ref1_51" id="R_ref1_51" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Sarker, 2021</a>). The data is already somewhat categorised. Examples of structured data include customer records, financial transactions, and inventory lists. This type of data is easily searchable, sortable, and analysed using conventional data processing tools. On the other hand, unstructured data is information that does not fit neatly into predefined categories or structures (<a href="#ref1_51" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Sarker, 2021</a>). It often requires specialised tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights. Examples of unstructured data include social media posts, emails, and customer feedback.</p>
<p>Different types of data can enhance the comprehensiveness and precision of data analysis. The availability of large amounts of data has allowed AI algorithms to learn and make predictions more accurately. With Big Data, AI models can be trained on larger datasets and make predictions that are more informed and reliable. As a result, managing, processing, and extracting insights from Big Data often requires specialised tools and techniques, for example data warehousing, machine learning, and distributed computing. Yet, it is not only the amount of data that is important &#x2013; it is what organisations do with the data. Big Data can be analysed for insights which lead to better decisions and strategic moves. <a href="#table1_1" id="R_table1_1">Table 1.1</a> shows a list of examples of various sources of Big Data (<a href="#ref1_1" id="R_ref1_1" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Agrawal et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#ref1_47" id="R_ref1_47" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Raghupathi &#x0026; Raghupathi, 2014</a>; <a href="#ref1_50" id="R_ref1_50" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Sagiroglu &#x0026; Sinanc, 2013</a>).</p>

<h4 id="sec1_3_1_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">1.3.1.1 </span>Characteristics of Big Data</h4>
<p>In 2001, Gartner analyst Doug Laney first introduced &#x201C;three Vs&#x201D; as the main traits of Big Data &#x2013; Volume, Velocity, and Variety (<a href="#ref1_28" id="R_ref1_28" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Laney, 2001</a>). These &#x201C;three Vs&#x201D; form a key framework which influences how organisations and researchers approach and use Big Data. In addition to Laney&#x2019;s work, studies have suggested other significant characteristics, such as Veracity, Variability, and Value (<a href="#ref1_21" id="R_ref1_21" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Jin et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref1_25" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kitchin &#x0026; McArdle, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref1_50" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Sagiroglu &#x0026; Sinanc, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref1_54" id="R_ref1_54" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Sharma, 2022</a>; <a href="#ref1_55" id="R_ref1_55" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Song &#x0026; Zhu, 2015</a>). These characteristics, summarised in <a href="#table1_2" id="R_table1_2">Table 1.2</a>, are often used to support organisations in making decisions regarding Big Data, and to determine the best ways to process, analyse, as well as extract insights from said data. <a href="#ref1_25" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kitchin and McArdle (2016)</a> provided a clear overview of the ontological traits of Big Data.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left"><b>Volume</b> refers to the large amounts of data generated and stored by organisations, individuals, and systems. With the rise of digital technologies, Big Data often involves petabytes, exabytes, or even zettabytes of data.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="left"><b>Velocity</b> refers to the speed at which data is generated and continuously processed. Big Data is generated and processed in real time, requiring us to respond quickly and use large amounts of processing power to keep up with changing circumstances.</td></tr>

<td class="left"><b>Variety</b> refers to the diverse types and formats of data present within Big Data. These can range from structured data, such as spreadsheets or databases, to unstructured data, such as texts from social media commentaries.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="left"><b>Veracity</b>, also known as data assurance, refers to the quality, accuracy, and integrity of the data (<a href="#ref1_16" id="R_ref1_16" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Gillis, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref1_47" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Raghupathi &#x0026; Raghupathi, 2014</a>). This is an important aspect as Big Data is only useful if the data is reliable and trustworthy. Examples include the completeness of data or data entry errors from typos and incorrect entries.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="left"><b>Variability</b> refers to the meaning of data constantly changing (<a href="#ref1_40" id="R_ref1_40" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">McNulty, 2017</a>). For example, the interpretation of certain words may depend on the specific context(s) in which they are used.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="left"><b>Value</b> refers to what can be done with data, and the value(s) that Big Data can offer (<a href="#ref1_16" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Gillis, 2021</a>). How value is inferred from data is distinct from case to case.</td></tr>

Data can be very complex in structure and may have complicated relationships, making it difficult to identify patterns, correlations, and insights. An example from the educational setting that demonstrates the complexity of Big Data is analysing large amounts of data from various sources for student retention. There may be multiple variables at play, such as individual student characteristics, academic support services, and pedagogies of institutions, which should be considered within the data analysis. The complexity of Big Data in this context requires advanced analytical skills, powerful data processing tools, and a robust data management infrastructure.</td></tr>

<td class="left"><b>Exhaustivity</b> refers to the comprehensiveness of the data being analysed (<a href="#ref1_36" id="R_ref1_36" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Mayer-Schonberger &#x0026; Cukier, 2013</a>). It signifies that the data should cover all aspects of the topic being analysed to provide a complete picture. An example is student performance, where exhaustiveness is achieved by including the entire population of students and not just capturing a sample, and that data is gathered from all related aspects, for example test scores, tutorial and homework completion rates, class participation levels, extra-curricular activities, and achievements, as well as teacher evaluations.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="left"><b>Relationality</b> refers to the relationship and connections between datasets and the ways in which they can be linked, related, and integrated to provide meaningful insights and information (<a href="#ref1_10" id="R_ref1_10" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Boyd &#x0026; Crawford, 2012</a>).

This includes the ability to add new data sources, and to combine or relate data from different sources to achieve a more comprehensive view of the information collected. For example, health records could be analysed with data generated from clinical research and healthcare devices, offering more comprehensive insights for the identification of disease patterns, as well as advance patient care and treatment.</td></tr></tbody></table></section>

<h4 id="sec1_3_1_2"><span epub:type="ordinal">1.3.1.2 </span>Example of Big Data and Its Characteristics in Higher Education</h4>
<p>Big Data in education &#x2013; for example, educational data and analytics regarding student learning &#x2013; has all of the above characteristics. The <i>volume</i> can refer to collecting and analysing large amounts of data from various sources, including student transcripts, test scores, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p5" aria-label=" page 5. Table on this page. " role="doc-pagebreak"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p6" aria-label=" page 6. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>demographic information, and attendance and engagement data from online learning platforms. The <i>velocity</i> of the data could refer to real-time updates of student progress and achievements on a learning platform. The <i>variety</i> of data sources collected can be vast, including grades, scores from assignments (such as reflective journals, video presentations, and portfolios), and data logs of student activity (such as logs from communication channels and attendance records). <i>Veracity</i> of the data may refer to students giving incorrect information with errors and typos, or missing data as students drop courses after a certain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p7" aria-label=" page 7. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>period of time. To address these challenges, institutions may use complex algorithms and models to extract insights from collected data, and make informed decisions for areas including student retention, curriculum design, and resource allocation. Integrating and analysing data from various sources and in different formats using innovative models may contribute to the <i>complexity</i> of the Big Data. <i>Variability</i> is another a concern, such as students having different learning paces and patterns. The <i>exhaustiveness</i> of the data is also a challenge, as the data collected may not capture the full picture of student performance. As an example, factors such as learning environment or socio-economic background which may influence student learning could be overlooked. The <i>relationality</i> of the data, such as linking students&#x2019; grades to the time of day and to the courses they have taken, can enable the system to provide meaningful insights. Finally, the <i>extensionality</i> of Big Data may refer to collection of data on students who fail, change programmes, undertake an overseas exchange, or take a gap year, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of student learning.</p></section></section>

<h3 id="sec1_3_2"><span epub:type="ordinal">1.3.2 </span>What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?</h3>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical objects and things (e.g., smartphones, smart watches, home automation controls, fitness trackers) which can interact and cooperate with each other through wired and wireless networks, as well as generate, exchange, send, and receive data (<a href="#ref1_5" id="R_ref1_5" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Atzori et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#ref1_30" id="R_ref1_30" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Li et al., 2015</a>). IoT devices generate vast amounts of data which, when combined with Big Data, can be used to train and improve AI algorithms. IoT and AI are highly complementary technologies, with AI capable of analysing the volumes of data generated by IoT devices, including real-time data, in order to provide valuable insights and facilitate prompt and automated decision-making. IoT could also be a game changer for sustainability: according to an article from the World Economic Forum (<a href="#ref1_3" id="R_ref1_3" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Arias et al., 2018</a>), 84% of existing IoT deployments have the ability to contribute to the achievement of the United Nations&#x2019; Sustainable Development Goals. IoT provides a platform to connect everything and everyone in a smarter way, improving our quality of life and benefitting our planet.</p>
<p>Those unfamiliar with IoT may hold a misconception that it only refers to devices connected to the Internet; however, IoT encompasses much more than that. Devices with electronics parts, software, and sensors that allow them to connect and exchange data, such as Bluetooth devices, are also part of IoT. The term &#x201C;Internet of Things&#x201D; was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 during his employment at Procter &#x0026; Gamble (<a href="#ref1_31" id="R_ref1_31" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Lueth, 2014</a>; <a href="#ref1_4" id="R_ref1_4" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Ashton, 2009</a>). During his work to optimise supply chains, he sought to bring to his senior management&#x2019;s attention, a promising technology known as <i>Radio Frequency Identification</i> &#x2013; RFID. Given the widespread popularity of the internet at the time and its relevance to the concept, Ashton labelled his presentation with the title, &#x201C;Internet of Things&#x201D;. However, it was only since 2010 that IoT began gaining widespread attention (<a href="#ref1_31" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Lueth, 2014</a>).</p>

<p>A smart classroom integrating different IoT systems and devices, such as sensors, cameras, laptops, tablets, interactive whiteboards, learning management systems, student information systems, printers, scanners, and wearable devices, is an example of how IoT can be implemented in education.</p>
<p><i>Connectivity</i> enables devices and systems to form a network for transmitting and receiving data as required. IoT in the classroom is <i>scalable</i>, capable of changing the scope of its <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p9" aria-label=" page 9. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>tasks and easily accommodating the number of devices connected. Each device in the network has a unique <i>identity</i>, ensuring that students and teachers can securely identify and access the devices and data they need. <i>Interoperability</i> enables seamless streamlining processes such as in the submission of assignments and sharing of documents or resources between students and teachers. <i>Security</i> is particularly important in a smart classroom as it is essential to protect data, especially sensitive information such as grades and students&#x2019; personal details, from unauthorised access. IoT devices in a smart classroom must be designed with robust security measures to ensure the protection of private and sensitive information. The devices in the network are also <i>autonomous</i>, meaning they can make decisions and take actions without human intervention. For example, if a room becomes too warm, a smart sensor can automatically adjust the temperature. The system further has <i>intelligence</i> capabilities such as machine learning algorithms, to process collected data and make predictions to benefit the class. This enables teachers to track student progress and identify areas where additional support is needed. The system follows industry <i>standardisation</i> to ensure that different devices from different vendors can work effectively and seamlessly together under standardised protocols. Additionally, the devices and systems used are designed for <i>sustainability</i>, utilising energy-efficient and waste-reduction technologies to reduce the carbon footprint, while maintaining cost-effectiveness with automatic lighting and air conditioning systems. By incorporating these characteristics, this smart classroom system example provides a solution for higher education institutions to improve student experiences, streamline operations with technologies, and create a more efficient and sustainable learning environment.</p></section></section></section>

<h2 id="sec1_4"><span epub:type="ordinal">1.4 </span>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)</h2>
<p>Generative AI (GenAI) is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves creating new data or content (<a href="#ref1_12" id="R_ref1_12" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Dilmegani, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref1_38" id="R_ref1_38" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">McKinsey Consultant, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref1_2" id="R_ref1_2" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Altexsoft, 2022</a>). The term &#x201C;generative&#x201D; refers to the capability of AI to produce novel outputs rather than simply reproducing, categorising, processing, and analysing inputs. It can generate anything from text, images, audio, and videos, to natural-language text and even computer coding.</p>
<p>The concept of GenAI is rooted in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence. One of the earliest references to such a technology can be found in the work of computer scientist John Hopfield in the 1980s, who proposed the idea of a &#x201C;Hopfield network&#x201D;, a type of computer neural network that could be trained to generate new patterns or sequences (<a href="#ref1_23" id="R_ref1_23" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kampakis, 2022</a>; <a href="#ref1_39" id="R_ref1_39" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">McKinsey Global Institute, 2018</a>). The fields of machine learning and artificial neural networks have evolved over time as researchers and practitioners worked to develop more sophisticated generative architecture and deep learning algorithms, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based models (e.g. GPT-3 Generative Pretrained Transformer 3). There are two important models in GenAI: Discriminative and Generative Modelling (<a href="#ref1_2" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Altexsoft, 2022</a>).</p>
<p><b>Discriminative modelling</b> is a type of machine learning approach that aims to classify or categorise existing data points into specific classes or categories. While this model is able to distinguish the boundaries between classes, it is trained only to tell the differences and does not understand how data is generated. Machine learning tasks using this approach are classified as <i>supervised machine learning tasks</i>. The goal of this approach is to discriminate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p10" aria-label=" page 10. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>or make a distinction between the different classes, and then make predictions based on the data it has been trained on.</p>
<p>For example, in education, let&#x2019;s say we want to develop a model that can predict whether a student will pass or fail a particular exam based on their past performance, test scores, and attendance records. The discriminative model would look at the data provided, identify the differences between students who passed the exam and those who failed, then make predictions based on those differences. The model is simply trying to distinguish between students who passed and those who failed &#x2013; it does not consider why students achieve certain outcomes, and only aims to make accurate predictions.</p>
<p><b>Generative modelling</b> is a type of machine learning approach that focuses on creating new data that resembles the data it was trained on, based on the patterns and relationships learned from existing data. Machine learning tasks using this approach are classified <i>as unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning tasks</i>. The goal of the generative modelling approach is to create new examples that are similar to those it has seen before, which are representative of the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.</p>
<p>An example of generative modelling in education could be a system that generates new questions for a quiz or test. The model would learn the patterns and distribution of past questions from a training set, and subsequently use that information to generate new questions that are similar in style and content. This could be useful for creating new practice problems for a class, adaptive tests for each student based on their learning progress, or creating unique tests for individual students to prevent cheating.</p>

<p>Today, GenAI is already widely applied across various industries, including image and audio synthesis, and text, code and video generation. For example, GenAI can be used to generate realistic images of objects or scenes which do not actually exist, or to create synthetic speech that sounds like a real person. GenAI can also be used to generate new designs or prototypes in fields such as engineering and architecture, or to generate new music compositions or pieces of art (<a href="#ref1_27" id="R_ref1_27" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kumar, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref1_33" id="R_ref1_33" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Marr, 2023</a>). <a href="#fig1_2" id="R_fig1_2">Figure 1.2</a> shows an example of an image synthesis and <a href="#table1_4" id="R_table1_4">Table 1.4</a> shows an example of a code generation. <a href="#table1_5" id="R_table1_5">Table 1.5</a> provides some examples of the types of applications and software of GenAI.</p>

<p>Most applications use a combination of image, text, code, video, and audio generation alongside machine learning algorithms to produce solutions to a problem. One example of how all of these could be used in a comprehensive educational tool could be through an intelligent tutoring system. This system can use GenAI algorithms to customise learning materials for individual students based on their learning needs and progress, produce personalised video lessons by narrating snippets of educational text or code, combine it with visual aids such as images or animations, in order to support students in understanding complex concepts. The system can also create assessment and grading descriptors to assess students&#x2019; understanding of materials, generating questions and quizzes to reinforce learning. Moreover, audio feedback can also be generated for students as based on their performance, providing guidance and encouragement in a natural and engaging manner. This example demonstrates the transformative capabilities of GenAI in education to create an immersive, personalised, and effective learning experience. By harnessing the power of AI, teachers can free up time and resources, allowing them to focus on other priorities like classroom instruction and providing support to students.</p></section></section>

<p>One particular AI tool that has gained massive popularity, including in education, is ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer). ChatGPT is a pretrained text-generation language model developed by OpenAI that uses a transformer-based language architecture (<a href="#ref1_56" id="R_ref1_56" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Srivastava, 2022</a>; <a href="#ref1_22" id="R_ref1_22" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Joshi, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref1_26" id="R_ref1_26" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kulshrestha, 2020</a>), a type of deep neural network well suited for natural language processing tasks. It has the ability to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. In addition, it has been trained on a massive amount of data which has allowed it to learn the patterns, styles, and complexities of human language, making it a remarkable tool for communication. With capabilities in language generation, translation, summarisation, and questioning and answering, ChatGPT has caused a huge ripple in the technological industry (<a href="#ref1_62" id="R_ref1_62" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Zaveri, 2023</a>).</p>
<p>The rise of ChatGPT and its popularity are connected to a number of factors: ChatGPT is redefining the boundaries of machine learning (<a href="#ref1_49" id="R_ref1_49" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Rosenbaum, 2023</a>); it is efficient in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p12" aria-label=" page 12. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>generating results with endless possibilities (<a href="#ref1_44" id="R_ref1_44" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Pace, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref1_45" id="R_ref1_45" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Petrova, 2023</a>); and it is knowledgeable with training from huge volumes of information (<a href="#ref1_52" id="R_ref1_52" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Shankland, 2023</a>). AI has been around for more than a decade, but recent advancements in the field have made it more accessible and user-friendly. With ChatGPT, OpenAI&#x2019;s decision to allow public access to the software, its user-friendly interface, and its ability to understand and respond to natural language in a human-like manner, sets it apart from previous AI models. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online and virtual interactions. The public has grown in their awareness and acceptance of online functionality given their increased experiences with remote working and learning, as well as through the increased popularity of online financing and shopping. As a result, there is a greater demand for innovative solutions like ChatGPT to cater to different needs of the public (<a href="#ref1_62" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Zaveri, 2023</a>).</p>
<p>Within the field of education, the pandemic has become a stimulus for individuals to recognise the benefits and potentials of full-time virtual learning. Before the pandemic, traditional, in-person teaching and learning was regarded as the sole, favoured, or most effective approach to education for many individuals. The sudden outbreak and spread of COVID-19, resulting in widespread lockdowns and social distancing measures, forced <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p13" aria-label=" page 13. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>universities, colleges, and schools to close their physical campuses and transition to virtual teaching and learning. With the sudden shift online, many have had to adapt and embrace online education, leading to gradual recognition of the possibilities and capabilities such a mode holds for delivering high-quality education. This has also opened up new opportunities for utilising technology in classrooms. For example, ChatGPT is expected to play a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p14" aria-label=" page 14. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>significant role in the future of teaching and learning, driving education to develop and undertake better practices by replacing those which could be automated (<a href="#ref1_20" id="R_ref1_20" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Jacobsen, 2023</a>). In the post-COVID era, we are beginning to see many educational institutions opening up to the possibility of allowing students to continue their education remotely, which increases accessibility and flexibility, as well as creates new opportunities for learning. Even renowned universities such as University College London (UCL) or Kings College London are providing numerous pathways to go remote by offering online Masters programmes (<a href="#ref1_58" id="R_ref1_58" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">UCL, n.d.</a>) and blended options for International Foundation programmes (<a href="#ref1_24" id="R_ref1_24" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">King&#x2019;s College London, n.d.</a>). Online courses allow students to attend lectures and complete assignments from the comfort of their own homes, which can save time and money on commuting. Moreover, virtual learning environments can be designed to promote inclusivity, better support students with special needs, and ensure that those in remote areas can still access teaching and learning. The growing demand for online learning has also led to the increased popularity and adoption of AI-powered virtual assistants like ChatGPT, which can further enhance the accessibility, efficiency, and effectiveness of education. For instance, ChatGPT can serve as a 24/7 virtual assistant that offers real-time responses to students&#x2019; queries, provide personalised support and guidance, and provide assistance in maintaining learning progress.</p>
<p>All in all, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online and virtual learning. As a result, behaviours and attitudes of the public have changed, and educational audiences are now much more receptive to the use of AI tools. We should also note that the recent surge of discussion regarding AI&#x2019;s impact on education is not necessarily late; despite the 50-year presence of AI, its impact on education has only gained considerable prominence with the recent advancement of ChatGPT. While tools like Google Translate may have made notable impacts on certain educational domains, its impact pales in comparison to the potentials of ChatGPT. With its capabilities of providing immediate and tailored feedback, facilitating natural language interactions, and serving as both a teaching and research assistant, ChatGPT and other GenAI tools have established themselves as a transformative force for higher education. Such technology has the potential to fundamentally change the way students learn while also supporting educators in overcoming challenges and obstacles in teaching and learning.</p></section>

<h2 id="sec1_6"><span epub:type="ordinal">1.6 </span>Generative AI Concerns and Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite its potential benefits, the utilisation of AI raises important ethical and social issues. These include concerns about job displacement, privacy, and accountability, as well as the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes. One of the key drivers behind the development of generative AI is the desire to elevate the creative process (<a href="#ref1_13" id="R_ref1_13" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Eapen et al., 2023</a>). By implementing algorithms and machine learning models, generative AI possesses the capacity to generate new and unique content that cannot be achieved through traditional, manual methods. However, the benefit of producing novel outputs also introduces potential drawbacks, including the risk of generating biased or unfair outputs, or content that is inappropriate or harmful. Several aspects are to be addressed: the need to strike a balance between human and machine values and control; the need to ensure that generated content is of high quality and relevancy; and the need to navigate the ethical considerations arising from the complex nature of AI. It is important that we carefully consider these issues as we continue to develop and deploy AI in across <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p15" aria-label=" page 15.

<p>In the simplest way of explaining, ChatGPT is a type of software trained on huge amounts of text. During its training phase, ChatGPT is exposed to vast amounts of text from variety of sources such as websites, books, forums. It learns by predicting the next word in sentences. The training helps ChatGPT to recognise patterns and structures in language. It uses a structure called the Transformer to weigh which parts of your question are most important and how your prompt relates to all the data it has trained on, and thus, GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><b>Input</b>: You type in a sequence of words (e.g., &#x201C;What is the capital of&#x201D;) also known as a prompt.</li>
<li><b>Encoding</b>: The model translates each word into a numerical representation called a vector. This representation captures the word&#x2019;s meaning and its relation to other words which it has been trained on.</li>
<li><b>Attention</b>: Using a method called &#x201C;self-attention&#x201D;, the ChatGPT model weighs the importance of each word in your question. For instance, in our example, &#x201C;capital&#x201D; might be given more weight than &#x201C;is&#x201D;. The goal is to grasp the essence of your question/prompt. Knowing the topic helps the model understand related words, like &#x201C;of&#x201D; and &#x201C;the&#x201D;.</li>
<li><b>Decoding &#x0026; Prediction</b>: Once the model understands the context of your question from the word weightings (attention) and relationship to other words it has been trained on (embedding), it starts predicting the best sequence of words for a response. This is based on the input &#x2013; the encoding information and the attention weights. GPT produces a series of words as an answer. Each word has a specific relevance to the topic and the other words. The model predicts the next word. Then it continues, using both the original input and the words it has already predicted to guess subsequent words. This process repeats until a full answer is formed or until the model decides the answer is complete.</li>
<li><b>Output</b>: The model provides the generated sequence of words as a response (e.g., &#x201C;The capital of France is Paris.&#x201D;).</li></ul>
<p>It is important to note that while this explanation provides an overview, the actual workings of the model involve a lot of intricate math and processes happening simultaneously. The model has been trained on billions of such sequences, refining its ability to make accurate and coherent predictions over time.</p></section></section>

<h2 id="sec1_8"><span epub:type="ordinal">1.8 </span>How does GenAI Generate Images from Text?</h2>
<p>For many readers, the concept of machines creating images based on textual descriptions might sound like science fiction. Yet, in GenAI, this has become a reality. To shed some light on this capability, we have crafted a high-level overview of how GenAI works in the context of generating images from text. Please refer to <a href="#fig1_5" id="R_fig1_5">Figure 1.5</a> for a visual representation. Those desiring a deeper dive can explore <a href="ch6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

<p>Computers work with numbers. Whether it is text, image, or sound, a computer interprets it as numbers. And every image is made of pixels. Each pixel has a colour, represented by three numbers: red, green, and blue (RGB). An image, then, is essentially a matrix of number trios. As you can see in <a href="#fig1_4" id="R_fig1_4">Figure 1.4</a>, digital images are represented by a size for example 1920 pixels &#x00D7; 1080 pixels. Each pixel represents a location on the image like x, y coordinates and then at each pixel there is a colour represented by three numbers for, one for the amount of red, another for the amount of green, and another for the amount of blue (RGB). This results in a matrix (array) of vectors (list of numbers) like [13,8,255,0,0] which can represent the whole image.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p17" aria-label=" page 17. Figure on this page. " role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p18" aria-label=" page 18. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>Much like how ChatGPT encounters enormous amounts of textual data, GenAI Image generation software is trained on vast visual and textual datasets. Think of it as an artist with an encyclopedic knowledge of styles, subjects, and scenes. This can range from simplistic drawings to intricate photographs.</p>
<p>Through this training process, GenAI learns the complexity between words and visuals. It begins to understand that the word &#x201C;sunset&#x201D; might evoke hues of orange and pink, or that a &#x201C;snowy mountain&#x201D; corresponds to white peaks against a clear sky.</p>
<p>One approach to GenAI&#x2019;s capability is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This involves a duo &#x2013; a generator (the artist) and a discriminator (the critic). The artist generates, and the critic evaluates. Over time, the generator gets better at producing images that can pass the discriminator&#x2019;s critique. <a href="#fig1_5">Figure 1.5</a> shows how text is prompted and generated into image.</p>

<h3 id="sec1_8_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">1.8.1 </span>So What Happens When You Type in a Question (Also Known as Prompt) to Generate an Image?</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><b>Input</b>: A user provides a textual prompt (e.g., &#x201C;A serene lake surrounded by autumn trees&#x201D;).</li>
<li><b>Textual Encoding</b>: This process is similar to understanding text generation. To produce an image from text, the model first encodes the text input into a meaningful numerical representation. This is usually done using a separate model, such as a trained transformer.</li>
<li><b>Image Generator</b>: Once the text is encoded into a numerical format, it is used as an input or condition for the generator. This process uses diffusion to create the image. Diffusion is a technique to make images fuzzy. This fuzzy appearance is similar to static on old televisions, often referred to as &#x201C;noise&#x201D;. Noise is merely random colours/pixels. You can make an image noisy by adding random numbers to its pixels. Conversely, to clarify a noisy image, you adjust the random numbers so they produce a coherent image. In this step, the generator then produces an image that corresponds to the textual description as shown in <a href="#fig1_6" id="R_fig1_6">Figure 1.6</a>.
<figure id="fig1_6"><img src="images/fig1_6_B.jpg" alt="The diffusion process is shown with a series of images that is clear at first and then fades into static."/>

<ul class="simple">
<li><b><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p19" aria-label=" page 19. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>Refinement</b>: The discriminator evaluates the generated image, ensuring its alignment with the initial description. This feedback loop, over multiple iterations, refines the visual output.</li>
<li><b>Output</b>: The result is a visual representation (e.g., an image of a calm lake with trees draped in autumnal colours) presented to the user as shown in <a href="#fig1_7" id="R_fig1_7">Figure 1.7</a>.

<p>The future of education is not just digital; it is smart, responsive, and tailored. Imagine classrooms that function like a high-tech ecosystem, adjusting to the needs of every student in real time. Imagine AI tools like ChatGPT, always ready to help, answering questions day or night. COVID-19 pushed us online, and now, tech like IoT and GenAI is taking us to the next level. The classroom of the future? It is innovative, flexible, and built on groundbreaking technology. As we ride this wave, one thing is clear: learning is about to get a whole lot more exciting.</p>

<h3 id="box1_1">Questions to Ponder</h3>
<ul class="disc">
<li>What will happen if higher education institutions ignore the existence of GenAI?</li>
<li>What will happen if higher education institutions embrace GenAI in teaching and learning?</li>
<li>What will happen if higher education institutions embrace GenAI in teaching and learning, but do not put in place any relevant teaching and learning policies to govern its implementation?</li>
<li>Is ChatGPT really only an ANI? It has the capacity to generate new data, and sometimes it seems to understand what we are asking beyond the prompt we enter.</li>
<li>If ChatGPT is undertaking unsupervised or semi-supervised machine learning tasks, how can we govern them to ensure certain biased, unethical tasks will not be allowed; wouldn&#x2019;t ChatGPT learn from its own generated content, and continue to come up with and use its own new ideas and concepts &#x2013; just like humans?</li></ul></aside>

<h3 id="box1_2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p21" aria-label=" page 21. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>Personal Reflection</h3>
<p>If COVID-19 never happened, I wonder how we would perceive online learning and tools like GenAI today? For me, I recalled implementing the e-learning policy at my university thirteen years ago, and trying to get people on board with e-learning was a real struggle. Without the pandemic forcing us to go online for work, school, and even socialising, would we still be dragging our feet? Maybe the convenience of GenAI tools would have won us over eventually, but certainly not as quickly. In a way, the pandemic forced us to dive into the deep end with new tech. Without this happening, perhaps we would still be dipping our toes, hesitant to fully plunge into digital learning. It is interesting to think about how necessity accelerates acceptance. What do you think? Would we have welcomed these smart tools without the push from a global crisis? It is a curious path to wander down, imagining the &#x201C;what ifs&#x201D;.</p></aside></section>
