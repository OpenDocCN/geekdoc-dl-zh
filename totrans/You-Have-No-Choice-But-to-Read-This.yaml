    He explains the studies that were first done in the 1980s by neuroscientist Benjamin
    Libet, in which scientists hooked subjects up to an EEG and asked them to “decide”
    to do something simple, like push a button.
  prefs: []

    the button arises about half a second before you’re consciously aware of making
    a decision. In other words, your subconscious hands a decision to your conscious
    mind, which then pretends like it decided to do the thing.

    replicated. But there are also a lot of holes. They concern relatively simple
    physical actions (like button pushing) that are done spontaneously; it’s possible
    other kinds of decisions happen differently. They also aren’t very predictive:
    if a researcher uses an fMRI to scan your brain, they can only determine with
    60 percent accuracy which button you’re going to press before you’re consciously
    aware of your decision.'

    ask: *where does that intent come from?* And then you get stuck back at the same
    causal chain: immediate situation, prior days and months, childhood development,

    is posed in the future, the more constraints are needed.” (page 351) He thinks

    responsibility exists (and it does not exist). This is mystical insight arrived
    at through science.

    traditions that espouse the same idea. For example, for thousands of years Buddhism
    has taught about dependent origination: everything that occurs is dependent on
    causes and conditions; nothing is separate.'

    slayer, another believes he is the slain. Both are ignorant; there is neither
    slayer nor slain… They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them.”'

- en: '*Determined* is a work of genius that is also a miss because mystical traditions
    have developed ways of integrating and operationalizing this insight into daily
    life. They understand it as a way to foster compassion, a different way of relating
    to the world around you. And they’ve developed techniques to make this insight
    alive and present. Experienced meditators often talk about the “self” as an illusion—another
    way of saying that they’ve glimpsed the ways in which their behaviors are the
    result of causes and conditions outside of their control.'

    But there’s nothing supernatural or superstitious about these kinds of experiences.
    That’s why he’s come to the same conclusions after decades of being a scientist.
