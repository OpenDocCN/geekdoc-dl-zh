    He explains the studies that were first done in the 1980s by neuroscientist Benjamin
    Libet, in which scientists hooked subjects up to an EEG and asked them to “decide”
    to do something simple, like push a button.

    physical actions (like button pushing) that are done spontaneously; it’s possible
    other kinds of decisions happen differently. They also aren’t very predictive:
    if a researcher uses an fMRI to scan your brain, they can only determine with
    60 percent accuracy which button you’re going to press before you’re consciously
    aware of your decision.'

    ask: *where does that intent come from?* And then you get stuck back at the same
    causal chain: immediate situation, prior days and months, childhood development,
    fetal development, genetic makeup, cultural environment, going all the way back

  zh: 在这个世界中，他认为我们可能仍然会有类似监狱来关押那些犯罪的人。我们可能仍然决定将谋杀犯与社会其他人隔离开来。但我们不会出于愤怒而这样做，也不会出于报复而这样做。Sapolsky认为，我们会“做到保护每个人所需的最低限度，而不多一分。”（第349页）他认为这样的模式比我们当前的司法体系更好，后者是向过去看的。（既然刚刚花了几百页来阅读我们的未来行为如何取决于我们的过去，我很难知道两者之间的区别。）
- en: Sapolsky believes that doing away with our conceptions of free will and moral
    responsibility is both possible *and* compassionate. It will bring about a better
    world where people are neither left to be the victims of circumstance nor blamed
    for the ways in which their biology hinders them.

- en: Sapolsky spends the end of the book musing about the consequences of believing

- en: 'Sapolsky’s argument can be summed up like this: “We are beings caught in an

    subject to circumstance. Therefore, we should choose to be better to each other.”'

    choices and, therefore, your belief in free will.

- en: Sapolsky seems to skim over the fact that determinism operates regardless of
    our belief in it. Our lack of free will operates in the same way. It’s an inescapable
    cosmic backdrop that is present whether or not you get up in the morning, whether
    or not you read philosophy books, whether or not your hands are tied behind your
    back, or whether or not you are in love, or grieving, or sick, or tired.

- en: The infinite chain of causes that Sapolsky refers to in order to explain our
    behavior shows us that we’re just a temporary arrangement of particles—an eddy
    in a stream, a pattern of the wind—subjected to and determined by everything that
    has ever come before us. It is beautiful. It shows that we are all connected.

- en: But the minute you refer to this chain and use it to justify your actions, you
    are no longer talking about this larger truth. Instead, you’re affirming your
    own free will and personal control. You are, from your own perspective, *making
    a free choice*—and you’re doing so because you know that choices matter. That’s
    the weird paradox at play here.

    to biology, we're not dismissing their agency wholesale; we're merely relocating
    it to other aspects of their lives where deterministic explanations haven't yet
    been applied or understood. In fact, relocation only becomes possible once we
    gain the scientific understanding to control those seizures. So even in acknowledging
    the deterministic nature of some behaviors, we're paradoxically affirming our
    agency to understand and manipulate them.

  zh: 但是这样做保留了——而不是否认了——代理权。当我们将某人的癫痫归因于生物学时，我们并没有全面否定他们的代理权；我们只是将其转移到尚未应用或理解决定性解释的其生活其他方面。事实上，只有在我们获得科学的理解来控制这些癫痫时，转移才成为可能。因此，即使我们承认某些行为的决定性特质，我们却悖论地肯定了我们理解和操纵它们的代理权。
