- en: When we bought Nvidia in January 2019, it was $33 a share. Today, it is $800
    a share. That was the trade of our lives. We want to find an investment that's
    just as good as our Nvidia investment using Gemini. And I think we can do it.
    Basically what we have done is we have downloaded earnings call transcripts from
    2022 and 2023.

    does. This is the stock that we came to at the end of a long journey, and I'll
    let you see it as I do it. We're going to swipe up to submit. Order received.
    So there we go.

    podcast you should know about. It’s hosted by Nathan Labenz, who was actually
    on this show and did one of the most popular episodes we’ve ever had about how
    to use AI as a copilot for the mind.
