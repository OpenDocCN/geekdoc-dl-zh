    purportedly beats GPT-4 on some benchmarks. Awesome! Except there was no easy
    link to try it. Most companies put a giant TRY NOW button at the top of their
    product announcements, but not Google.

    Garbage Patch](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/great-pacific-garbage-patch/)
    trying to find a goddamn way to actually use the thing. It was easier to cancel
    my gym membership than to get access to its chatbot.

    I found a sentence in the post that explained that while Gemini is available in
    Bard—Google’s ChatGPT competitor—immediately, its most performant version—the
    one that beats GPT-4—won’t be out until next year. *Daddy Googs giveth, and Daddy
    Googs taketh away.*

    published in the last few years, figure out which ones contained relevant new
    science, extract the findings, and [construct a review paper with what it learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiOP_CB54A).
    It’s also [very good at coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvGmVmHv69s),
    and it has a neat UI that builds [bespoke software experiences as you chat with
    it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5tRc_5-8G4). It can do these things better
    than previous versions because it has an enhanced ability to plan tasks in advance.

- en: 'We’ll see how it goes when the most capable version is released, but Gemini
    raises an interesting question:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Does Bard have a future as a destination chatbot? It almost certainly has a
    future in the context of other Google products. In other words, as long as I’m
    using Gmail or typing searches in Chrome, I’ll use Bard because it will be built
    in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But will I, or anyone else, *go to Bard* by choice? Right now, I do that with
    ChatGPT and Claude. Do I have room for one more? Ten? How many chatbots will become
    destinations? Let’s unpack.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why Bard could succeed
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two obvious reasons that Bard could become a destination. First, it
    gets to leverage Google’s massive distribution by being built into Chrome, Gmail,
    Docs, and more. As a result, it will be the first AI experience for many millions
    of people—and it will reap the rewards of the habit it creates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, it has access to all of the data you and I and everyone else has saved
    in Google. I’ve written a lot about the idea that [access to knowledge is the
    most important bottleneck](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/a-few-things-i-believe-about-ai?sid=29029)
    for the quality of LLM results, and Google has a massive advantage. The fact that
    Bard can already reference all of my emails and documents is going to have a big
    impact on how good it is at saying smart things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there’s a third, less obvious reason that Bard might be able to become a
    destination. Talking to a chatbot is a lot like talking to a friend. And—as shown
    by the 197 unread text messages on my phone right now (sorry if that’s you)—I
    chat with a lot of different friends at once. Our brains are wired to remember
    many different people, and to know when and why we might want to talk to them.
    I have a small circle of people who I text all day, every day. A slightly larger
    circle that I text a few times a week or month to make plans or share memes. And
    I have a much larger circle of people I text in specific circumstances. For example,
    there’s a friend I text when [a new steak video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymruApQ-C0U)
    drops on YouTube—but we don’t talk about anything else. (Male friendships are
    weird.)

    maintain at once—usually about 150 of varying relationship strengths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If chatbots are human enough to get filed in the same part of our brain that
    deals with relationships, they might have a similar dynamic with us. This might
    leave room for Bard, even in a world where ChatGPT continues to charge ahead.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google can’t ship. Most of the research that OpenAI is built on happened at
    Google—[and yet Google fumbled the bag](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-gemini-eats-the-world-gemini).
    As I’ve written before, aside from knowledge orchestration, the other thing holding
    back [result quality from LLMs is risk tolerance](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/artificial-limits?sid=29060).
    Organizations that are willing to take more risks will be able to build better
    AI products.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google is not in a position to take a lot of risk because it is a giant company,
    and every move it makes affects hundreds of millions of people. Big companies
    always mess up big technology transitions—think about Blackberry in the iPhone
    era—so it was smart for Microsoft to partner with OpenAI. Microsoft owns all of
    the IP that OpenAI produces, so it gets the benefit of the progress the startup
    can make; at the same time, OpenAI is separate enough so that it doesn’t get choked
    by Microsoft’s sclerotic bureaucracy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another force going against Bard is that there are likely to be winner-take-all
    dynamics in chat.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To completely contradict a point I made above, chatbots are *not* human. Therefore,
    we may treat them like other software products: we will only remember the ones
    that we use multiple times a day. In a world where this is true, usage will probably
    trend toward most people using the best chatbot available—and right now that’s
    ChatGPT.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This dynamic creates a compounding position for ChatGPT: the more users it
    has, the more data it has that it can use to make the product better, which will
    attract more users. There are also secondary positive feedback loops in the form
    of historical chats. One example: ChatGPT is likely to integrate a memory that
    can recall things you’ve said to it in the past—improving result quality and preventing
    people from switching.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this way, the chatbot space might look a lot like search. There will be one
    dominant player (like Google). There will also be lots of little chatbots integrated
    into existing experiences that people already use (like search boxes on individual
    websites). But the opportunity for the latter will be tiny compared to the former.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My gut is that the Dunbar number for destination chatbots is one. In other words,
    we’re likely to find ourselves in a world with a single dominant destination chatbot.
    I think that’s going to be ChatGPT. It’s currently the best one out there and
    has a great data flywheel. OpenAI has the highest density of talent, and with
    Sam Altman back, it’s newly focused and invigorated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*But* I think there will be a demand from users to interact with many chatbots
    within the single destination that they visit. I think ChatGPT will iterate custom
    GPTs to the point where you’ll have different ones that you might interact with
    on a given day—or in a given situation. Our brains are wired for this—remember,
    we can maintain up to 150 social relationships at a time—so the possibilities
    are pretty wild.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can already see the beginnings of this with chat platforms like [Poe](https://poe.com/),
    which allows you to interact with GPT-4, Claude, and user-customized versions
    of each within the same interface. [Character.AI](https://beta.character.ai/)
    has landed on a similar concept for allowing users to interact with chatbots that
    have different personalities and memories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT might at some point resemble something like Slack, but populated with
    one human and many different bots. Instead of chatting with one bot at a time
    like you do now, you may have a single channel where you can chat with many different
    bots at once—all offering their perspective and expertise when appropriate.
