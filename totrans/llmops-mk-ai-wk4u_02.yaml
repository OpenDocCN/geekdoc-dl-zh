- en: This book is a practical guide for data scientists, ML engineers, developers,
    and anyone working with modern AI. We explore LLMs, conversational AI, and LLM
    integration into development processes, with a focus on LLMOps (MLOps for Large
    Language Models). The goal is to provide clear tools and approaches to harness
    AI's potential in practice.

    (customer support with chatbots, personalization with recommendations, efficiency
    improvements with MLOps). The book helps bridge the gap between complex technologies
    and practice, showing how to use AI for growth and value.'
