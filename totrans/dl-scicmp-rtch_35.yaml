    extend infinitely. Instead, they are localized in time: Away from the center,
    they quickly decay to zero. In addition to a *location* parameter, they also have
    a *scale*: At different scales, they appear squished or stretched. Squished, they
    will do better at detecting high frequencies; the converse applies when they’re
    stretched out in time.'

    a systematic, general introduction, the way I did in the DFT chapter. Instead,
    I’m going to heavily lean on one specific exposition, the one in Arnt Vistnes’

    point-wise similarity is what matters. Concretely, assume the signal is a pure
    sine wave, the wavelet we’re using is a windowed sinusoid like the Morlet, and

    one analysis window.
