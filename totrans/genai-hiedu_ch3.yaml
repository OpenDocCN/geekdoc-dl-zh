    and relate concepts in complex ways. Yet it sometimes struggles with simple tasks.
    Maybe it isn’t showing deep understanding, but rather mimicking human argument
    patterns through the data it trained from. It might be more of an ‘accidental
    intelligence’ than ‘artificial intelligence’. Perhaps many humans also employ
    similar techniques.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The User-Centric Design characteristic of GenAI refers to the systematic approach
    of placing the user at the core of its design and development processes. User-centric
    design applications are easy to understand, simple to operate, and, above all,
    user-friendly ([Chow, 2023](#ref3_11)). It involves the careful crafting of interfaces,
    functionalities, and processes that are inherently intuitive, thereby reducing
    the cognitive load on users and enabling them to interact with the system effortlessly.
    In GenAI, user-centric design translates to algorithms and models that not only
    produce high-quality outputs, but also ensure that the interaction, input methods,
    and result interpretations are straightforward and accessible to a wide range
    of users, regardless of their technical proficiency. The goal of a user-centric
    design is to ensure that advanced AI technology is accessible and comprehensible
    to all. [Figures 3.1](#fig3_1) and [3.2](#fig3_2) show the user-friendly dialogue

    to interact with GenAI tools, often in conjunction with voice-based, image-based,
    gesture-based, and video-based interfaces. The user prompts the GenAI system with
    a question, comment, or statement, and receives a response from the system. This
    simple and easy-to-operate interaction style allows users to quickly understand
    how to use the tool, and derive value from it almost instantly. This type of interaction
    is familiar in educational settings, resembling a dialogue between a student (the
    user) and a tutor or teacher (the ChatGPT system). It is worth noting that the
    capability to interact with text is not only important but also practical, as
    we don’t always desire vocalising thoughts ([Long, 2018](#ref3_23)), which is
    also one of the reasons for the popularity of many text-based messaging tools.
    According to studies (e.g., [Edison Software, 2019](#ref3_13); [Long, 2018](#ref3_23)),
    both Gen-Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) and Millennials (those born between

    communicate in a manner that resonates with human empathy, understanding, and
    natural flow, creating a more relatable and engaging user experience. Users may
    find themselves conversing with tone, emphasis, and emotion in a way that feels
    more natural, as if speaking with a human on the other end of the line ([Browne,
    2023](#ref3_6); [Shankland, 2023](#ref3_32)). In contrast to old-style AI chatbots,
    which were typically rule-based or with pre-programmed responses and limited in
    the ability to generate varied and complex responses, GenAI tools such as ChatGPT
    can create their own responses and outputs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This opens up new possibilities for human interaction with technology, including
    the capability for more natural and engaging conversations with AI-powered chatbots
    or virtual assistants. In higher education, this characteristic ensures that AI-driven
    platforms can facilitate supportive, intuitive, and contextually relevant interactions
    with users. For example, a GenAI with a humanistic conversational style might
    be utilised in a virtual learning environment to provide students with academic
    guidance. The AI, seeing the input from student stresses or inquiries, could offer
    supportive feedback, relevant resources, and timely advice, much like a human
    tutor. It would understand and process natural language inquiries, responding
    in a manner that is both informative and affectively resonant, thereby fostering
    an educational environment that is not only intellectually stimulating but also
    constructively supportive. This anthropomorphic interaction style has the potential
    to significantly enhance online learning experiences, providing students with
    a virtual companion that assists and understands them throughout their academic
    journey ([Chan & Lee, 2023](#ref3_9)). Furthermore, it encourages more organic
    and authentic communication, which can enhance user engagement and satisfaction.
    This is particularly vital in education, where student engagement is crucial for
    effective learning and retention. [Table 3.1](#table3_1) demonstrates the humanistic

    the example of ChatGPT, when faced with unclear or broad requests, it does not
    usually ask for clarification or indicate that it cannot provide information due
    to the vague nature of the question. Instead, it attempts to provide the best
    answer it can, offering some context in its response to help users refine their
    requests or prompts if necessary. This creates a smoother and more enjoyable conversational
    flow, bypassing the frustrating problems we may have encountered with older AI
    technologies that needed more information or required question rephrasing before
    providing any potentially valuable answers. Responses from GenAI tools can be
    beneficial in enhancing student learning. First, students will learn how to better
    articulate their questions and provide more accurate directions. Second, students
    often learn from these responses and gain additional information to improve their
    self-learning.

    twice does not always yield the same response. Each interaction is slightly different
    due to the way GenAI works, leading to varied outcomes ([Weisz et al., 2023](#ref3_35)).
    This may surprise some users, as computers and AI are often expected to be highly
    consistent. However, this variability is intentional in design, aimed at making
    interactions with the AI more dynamic and less deterministic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Variability is like talking to different people about a given topic. Usually,
    if we ask the same person the same question over and over, we will get a response
    that is exactly the same or very similar. However, posing the same question to
    various people will likely elicit different responses, some slightly different,
    others more significantly so. However, while GenAI can produce varied responses,
    it is also designed to maintain a degree of consistency, particularly in providing
    accurate and reliable information. The variability mainly originates from the
    expression of information or in the inclusion of additional context, rather than
    the core message or accuracy of the information provided. In other words, although
    responses might be formulated or phrased differently, they should all remain relevant
    to the input prompt.

    interpret, and generate content across various forms of input and output, such
    as text, image, voice, and even video ([Google Cloud Blog, 2023](#ref3_15); [OpenAI,
    2023](#ref3_26)). This ensures a versatile and adaptive user experience as the
    AI is able to communicate and interact through multiple modes of interaction.
    In the context of higher education, this becomes profoundly impactful. For instance,
    a GenAI tool with multimodal capabilities can assist students in various ways:
    it can interpret a student’s verbal question, analyse a related image, and provide
    a text-based answer ([Lim et al., 2023](#ref3_22); [Vartiainen & Tedre, 2023](#ref3_33)).
    Moreover, during virtual classes or study sessions, the AI can comprehend a spoken
    question, retrieve relevant textual data from educational resources, convert it
    into a concise summary, and then present it in an easily comprehensible visual
    format, such as an infographic or a short video. In research activities, it can
    process textual data to generate relevant visual graphs or even transform data
    across modalities to cater to different learning preferences and needs. The flexibility
    offered by multimodal GenAI ensures that learning and teaching experiences are
    not only rich and varied, but also widely accessible, catering to diverse learning
    styles and sensory preferences within the academic community. Consequently, it
    holds the potential to substantially elevate the efficiency and inclusiveness
    of educational experiences in higher learning institutions.'

    of applications and manage varying levels of workloads, from generating short
    text snippets to producing longer content pieces. This adaptability allows GenAI
    tools to serve a varied and growing number of users, handle larger datasets, and
    perform more complex computations without compromising efficiency or user experience
    ([Chow, 2023](#ref3_11)). In the context of higher education, scalability is essential
    in managing varied educational processes and serving growing student populations.
    For instance, a scalable GenAI tool can efficiently support a small group of users,
    such as a single classroom, while also possessing the capability to seamlessly
    meet the extensive needs of an entire university. This could involve transitioning
    from handling basic queries related to course content and schedules, to managing
    more complex and multi-faceted tasks, such as grading assignments, providing personalised
    feedback, or even generating adaptive learning paths for a diverse range of courses
    and student demographics. Moreover, as the need for research and data analysis
    increases, a scalable AI system could effectively process and analyse large datasets,
    enabling researchers and educators to derive meaningful insights, predict trends,
    and ultimately enhance academic decision-making. Therefore, scalability in GenAI

    raised by text-based GenAI tools for higher education, especially in shaping curriculum
    design and innovative pedagogy. However, like any technology, while it can transform
    the way we teach and learn, there are also challenges and potential threats that
    must be considered. It is a classic case of ‘every rose has its thorn(s)’. In
    this section, our exploration turns towards understanding these challenges, using
    the example of ChatGPT’s GPT-4.
  prefs: []

    there is a genuine risk of information overload. The sheer volume of content it
    can generate has the potential to distract students from focusing on core curriculum
    topics, leading them down endless tangents of information. This becomes particularly
    problematic if students are weak in information literacy and prioritise intriguing,
    yet peripheral, AI-generated content over foundational curriculum concepts.

    ([Arora et al., 2023](#ref3_3); [Chan & Hu, 2023](#ref3_8); [Ferrara, 2023](#ref3_14)).
    If biases exist in their training datasets, AI outputs could mirror these biases,
    offering skewed perspectives that may mislead or misinform students. AI models
    may also unintentionally reinforce such biases, resulting in unbalanced educational
    content that could either bolster stereotypes or omit certain viewpoints. It is
    also worth noting that while GenAI tools such as ChatGPT have been trained to
    decline inappropriate requests, it is still possible for it to make mistakes or
    generate responses that are not aligned with these guidelines for appropriate
    use. As a result, it is important for users and developers to monitor the outputs
    of AI tools and to provide additional training, or adjust the system as needed
    to ensure that it continues to generate appropriate responses. According to a
    Bloomberg article ([Nicoletti & Bass, 2023](#ref3_25)), text-to-image GenAI models
    such as Stable Diffusion can amplify stereotypes on race and gender, surpassing
    the levels observed in reality. Through an analysis of over 5,000 images generated
    by Stable Diffusion, the article illustrated how the model intensifies racial
    and gender imbalances, emphasising that the widespread use of GenAI tools not
    only perpetuates existing stereotypes, hindering progress towards achieving more
    equitable representation, but also poses a risk of unjust practices. For example,
    utilising a biased text-to-image AI for generating sketches of suspected criminals
    could potentially lead to wrongful convictions.'

    data it is trained on. However, sourcing training data predominantly from online
    platforms introduces inherent biases. One notable bias arises from the digital
    divide, where certain populations such as older individuals or those in technologically
    underserved regions are underrepresented due to limited computer usage or online
    presence. This lack of representation may lead to AI having a skewed understanding
    of human demographics and preferences. Additionally, the dominance of the English
    language in online data introduces another inherent biases in AI systems. Many
    AI models are trained on datasets where English is overrepresented, which can
    marginalise non-English speakers and overlook the cultural and linguistic diversity
    of other languages and dialects. Moreover, the cultural bias is evident as Western
    cultures tend to be more represented in online data compared to Asian or other
    non-Western cultures. This cultural bias can further perpetuate stereotypes and
    misrepresentations.

    as individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds may have unequal levels
    of online presence or representation in digital data. The limited representation
    of individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds and resulting potential
    bias in AI models means that the latter will fail to accurately reflect the needs
    and experiences of these communities, even deepening existing disparities and
    inequalities.

    based on the sources of its training data. If the data predominantly comes from
    politically biased sources, the AI system may mirror them, resulting in problematic
    outcomes especially in contexts requiring neutrality and balanced perspectives.
    An article by [Rozado (2023)](#ref3_1002) discussed the potential for political
    biases in large language models (LLMs) and the concerns surrounding their misuse.
    It shared findings from a study where 15 different political orientation tests
    were administered to ChatGPT. The results were significant, with 14 out of the
    15 tests indicating that ChatGPT’s responses inclined towards left-leaning viewpoints.
    The article suggests that for ethical AI practices, systems should provide users
    with balanced arguments regarding the matter discussed, and refrain from claiming
    neutrality while displaying evident political bias in their content.

- en: The rise of GenAI has not only revolutionised various sectors but also brought
    about new career opportunities, one of which is ‘Prompt Engineering’. A glance
    at job ads with eye-catching salaries for prompt engineers, and articles from
    *Forbes* ([Cook, 2023](#ref3_12)) and *Time* ([Popli, 2023](#ref3_29)), shows
    the escalating demand and significance of this role. However, what exactly is
    prompt engineering and why is it important? Prompt engineering is the bridge between
    human language and machine understanding, ensuring smooth, intuitive interactions
    between the two. This section discusses the art and science of prompt engineering,
    explaining its necessity and the strategies involved in designing effective prompts
    to converse with GenAI.

    processing models, are prompts. They serve as cues or instructions, guiding the
    GenAI system to generate relevant outputs. Whether it is asking Siri to set a
    reminder or Bing Chat to retrieve information, prompts are how we start our conversations
    with GenAI. The effectiveness of such interactions greatly depends on how well
    we craft our prompts. Better prompts not only enhance our experience with AI,
    but also optimise the model’s performance, making AI more useful and efficient
    as a tool in our daily lives.

- en: The importance of prompt engineering is crucial for a multitude of AI utilisations,
    making it an essential skill. It can help with debugging, tweaking AI models,
    and ensuring resource efficiency – for example, when our prompts are more detailed
    and accurate, the model will be able to generate desired outputs more quickly
    and efficiently, using less computational resources overall. In a world where
    AI–human collaborations will become increasingly prevalent, mastering prompt engineering
    will be a technical requirement as well as a pathway to making AI more intuitive
    and better aligned with human expectations. It is a skill key to our future-readiness.

    Instead, we must understand the Prompt Engineering Components and apply them sensibly.
    Below we include seven useful Components – Instruction, Context, Role, Succinctness,
    Example, Format, and Readjustment, as shown in [Figure 3.4](#fig3_4). For readers
    to practice applying these, we provide a ‘Try-It Prompt’ at the end of each component
    description below. Using the example of “Constructivism in Education”, these example
    prompts provide a concrete context to understand how the “Prompt Engineering Components”

    the AI with a clear directive on what it should generate or provide. It is akin
    to asking a precise question to obtain a precise answer. The clarity of instruction
    helps steer the AI towards the desired output, ensuring the responses are aligned
    with, and relevant to, the user’s expectations. For example, in higher education,
    instructing an AI to summarise a research article sets a clear task for it to
