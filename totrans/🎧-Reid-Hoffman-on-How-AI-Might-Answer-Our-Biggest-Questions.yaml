    human nature, and the meaning of life, and, over time, learns how to think clearly
    about the big picture. This is a powerful tool for founders faced with existential
    questions about their product, consumers, and competitors, and enables them to
    respond with well-reasoned answers and enviable clarity of thought.

    or phrases, are converted into a language that computers can understand, like
    numbers. To understand how this is done, imagine mapping the qualitative data
    in a space in a way that preserves as much of the context and meaning of the original
    data as possible. For instance, words that appear in similar contexts, like ‚Äúapple‚Äù
    and ‚Äúorange,‚Äù will be closer together than words that are unrelated, like ‚Äúapple‚Äù
    and ‚Äúking.‚Äù This proximity is what gives embeddings their power, as algorithms
    can now perform mathematical operations on words, essentially treating them like

    calculates the probabilities of many possible next words and chooses the most

    we discuss LLMs and the way they function:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Essentialism** is the idea that things have a set of characteristics that
    make them what they are, and these characteristics are both necessary and inherent
    to their identity. For example, in essentialism, the category of ‚Äúdog‚Äù implies
    that there are certain features‚Äîlike having four legs and a tail, and incessantly
    barking at doorbells‚Äîthat are essential to something being recognized as a dog.
    These features are not just arbitrary but are believed to stem from the essence
    of what it means to be a dog.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Nominalism** argues that the categories that give our world logical structure
    are merely names we have agreed upon and do not necessarily reveal any inherent
    truth about the nature of things. To use the same example, the category ‚Äúdog,‚Äù
    is simply a convenient way to group animals with certain features together, but
    there isn''t necessarily a ‚Äúdog-ness‚Äù that all dogs share beyond the features
    we''ve decided are important for our classification purposes.'

    is usually described as leaning toward essentialism in his early works, while
    adopting nominalism in the later years of his life. We refer to the former as
    **early Wittgenstein** and the latter as **late Wittgenstein**.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The main difference between essentialism and nominalism lies in how they view
    the relationship between things and the categories they belong to. Essentialism
    sees categories as reflecting underlying realities, while nominalism views them
    as constructs without inherent truths. Reid thinks LLMs don‚Äôt ‚Äúresolve the debate‚Äù
    between essentialism and nominalism, but ‚Äúadd perspective and color‚Äù to it. Here
    are some of his specific thoughts on this topic:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Next-token prediction aligns with nominalism.** Reid believes that the way
    LLMs operate, particularly next-token prediction, is more compatible with nominalism
    and the views of late Wittgenstein because the models operate based on statistical
    patterns without any understanding of inherent meanings. However, he adds that
    as LLMs become more advanced, they are being developed to ‚Äúembody more essentialist
    characteristics,‚Äù such as ‚Äúground[ing] in truth [and] hav[ing] [fewer] hallucination[s].‚Äù'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**LLMs are being developed to be more essentialist.** Going one step deeper,
    Reid explains that LLMs are being developed to ‚Äúmake them much more reliable on
    a truth base.‚Äù ‚Äú[W]e love the creativity and the generativity, but‚Ä¶for a huge
    amount of the really useful cases in terms of amplifying humanity, we want it
    to have a better truth sense,‚Äù he says.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I asked Reid how he thought about the operation of embeddings as being nominalist
    because the way qualitative data (like a word) is mapped in a space represents
    the essence of that data (the meaning and particular context in which that word
    is being used), aligning with an essentialist focus on the data‚Äôs inherent meaning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Embeddings, too, align with nominalism.** Reid explains that embeddings are
    a ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù and the construction of the space in which, say a word, is mapped,
    and the factors that localize this word in that space, is more late Wittgenstein
    because it‚Äôs dependant on how the word is used in practice, rather than some deep
    underlying logical ordering.'

- en: '**Training LLMs on specific types of data.** Reid also shares that we are trying
    to develop LLMs to reason better by training them on data that has really crisp
    reasoning. They are ‚Äúlearning machines, so you have to give a fairly substantive
    corpus of data for them to learn from.‚Äù'

    and our perception of the world around us is shaped by the technologies we engage

    that we engage and bring into our being,‚Äù he explains.'
