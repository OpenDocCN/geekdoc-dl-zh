    in a space in a way that preserves as much of the context and meaning of the original
    data as possible. For instance, words that appear in similar contexts, like ‚Äúapple‚Äù
    and ‚Äúorange,‚Äù will be closer together than words that are unrelated, like ‚Äúapple‚Äù

    make them what they are, and these characteristics are both necessary and inherent
    to their identity. For example, in essentialism, the category of ‚Äúdog‚Äù implies
    that there are certain features‚Äîlike having four legs and a tail, and incessantly
    barking at doorbells‚Äîthat are essential to something being recognized as a dog.

    as LLMs become more advanced, they are being developed to ‚Äúembody more essentialist
