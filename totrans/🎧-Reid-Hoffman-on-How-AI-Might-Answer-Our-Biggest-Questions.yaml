    or phrases, are converted into a language that computers can understand, like
    numbers. To understand how this is done, imagine mapping the qualitative data
    in a space in a way that preserves as much of the context and meaning of the original
    data as possible. For instance, words that appear in similar contexts, like “apple”
    and “orange,” will be closer together than words that are unrelated, like “apple”
    and “king.” This proximity is what gives embeddings their power, as algorithms
    can now perform mathematical operations on words, essentially treating them like

    make them what they are, and these characteristics are both necessary and inherent
    to their identity. For example, in essentialism, the category of “dog” implies
    that there are certain features—like having four legs and a tail, and incessantly
    barking at doorbells—that are essential to something being recognized as a dog.
    These features are not just arbitrary but are believed to stem from the essence
    of what it means to be a dog.'

    are merely names we have agreed upon and do not necessarily reveal any inherent

    is simply a convenient way to group animals with certain features together, but
    there isn''t necessarily a “dog-ness” that all dogs share beyond the features
    we''ve decided are important for our classification purposes.'

    **early Wittgenstein** and the latter as **late Wittgenstein**.

    the relationship between things and the categories they belong to. Essentialism
    sees categories as reflecting underlying realities, while nominalism views them
    as constructs without inherent truths. Reid thinks LLMs don’t “resolve the debate”
    between essentialism and nominalism, but “add perspective and color” to it. Here
    are some of his specific thoughts on this topic:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Next-token prediction aligns with nominalism.** Reid believes that the way
    LLMs operate, particularly next-token prediction, is more compatible with nominalism
    and the views of late Wittgenstein because the models operate based on statistical
    patterns without any understanding of inherent meanings. However, he adds that
    as LLMs become more advanced, they are being developed to “embody more essentialist
    characteristics,” such as “ground[ing] in truth [and] hav[ing] [fewer] hallucination[s].”'
  id: totrans-32

    Reid explains that LLMs are being developed to “make them much more reliable on
    a truth base.” “[W]e love the creativity and the generativity, but…for a huge
    amount of the really useful cases in terms of amplifying humanity, we want it
    to have a better truth sense,” he says.'

- en: I asked Reid how he thought about the operation of embeddings as being nominalist
    because the way qualitative data (like a word) is mapped in a space represents
    the essence of that data (the meaning and particular context in which that word
    is being used), aligning with an essentialist focus on the data’s inherent meaning.

  zh: 我问里德对于嵌入式的运作是否符合名实主义的看法，因为那种定性数据（比如一个词）在空间中的映射代表了这些数据的本质（这个词的意义和具体上下文中它的使用方式），与数据本身含义的本质关注相符。
- en: '**Embeddings, too, align with nominalism.** Reid explains that embeddings are
    a “network” and the construction of the space in which, say a word, is mapped,
    and the factors that localize this word in that space, is more late Wittgenstein
    because it’s dependant on how the word is used in practice, rather than some deep
    underlying logical ordering.'

    to develop LLMs to reason better by training them on data that has really crisp
    reasoning. They are “learning machines, so you have to give a fairly substantive

    also evolve with technology in a “cultural evolution” that is much faster than
    biological or geological evolution, and AI is intensifying this process. “[P]art
    of what we''re doing with AI and LLMs is [creating] tools to help accelerate that

- en: '**Generate customized answers with ChatGPT.** According to Reid, another way
    for an aspiring philosophy student to acquaint themself with fundamental theories
    is to use ChatGPT to generate tailored explanations. He recommends prompts like,
    “I’m a non-mathematical college graduate, explain Godel’s theorem to me,” or “I’m
    a non-physicist, explain Einstein’s thought experiments around relativity to me.”'

    Reid points to is using the model as an on-demand, personal research assistant
    to help you solve problems better and more efficiently. “An immediate research
    assistant is one of the things that is obviously here already today and if you
    don''t think you need a research assistant, it''s because you just haven''t thought
    about it enough,” he remarks.'
