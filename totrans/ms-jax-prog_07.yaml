- en: Overfitting, a common challenge in machine learning, especially in neural networks,
    occurs when a model becomes too attuned to the training data, hindering its ability
    to generalize to new, unseen data. Regularization techniques step in as the superheroes,
    introducing constraints to prevent the model from memorizing the training data
    excessively and encouraging it to learn more broadly applicable patterns.

    in the neural network. L1 regularization adds the absolute value of weights to
    the loss function, while L2 regularization squares the weights. This prompts the
    model to favor smaller weights, curbing complexity and preventing overfitting.
