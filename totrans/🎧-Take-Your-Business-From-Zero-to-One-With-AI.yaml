    any entrepreneur go from idea to pitch deck, working website, custom GPT, and
    user interviews with real customers. All in just a few minutes, based on the entrepreneur‚Äôs
    responses to a few simple questions.

    a user live on the show. He also tells me that he used ChatGPT to prototype most
    of Audos‚Äôs features‚Äîdespite being non-technical himself. Nicholas shares exactly
    how he did this by showing me how he‚Äôs using AI to create a new feature for the
    product.

    shouldn‚Äôt preemptively evaluate their ideas without gathering feedback from potential
    customers, a function AI tools can enable. ‚Äú[A]s much as possible, not *a priori*
    making judgments about which of [the founders] ideas were good ones, but instead,
    just building some early momentum and seeing if anything stuck,‚Äù he explains.'

    Nicholas advises early-stage founders to remain as connected to their customers
    as possible. He believes that AI can maintain this connection as the business
    grows by ‚Äúinterfac[ing] with [customers]‚Äù and performing tasks that would otherwise
    require hiring, thus avoiding ‚Äúgetting sucked back into the organization.‚Äù'

    Nicholas finds that founders typically become less involved in the execution of
    their ideas. He asks,‚ÄúWhat happens if you can be the first draft maker longer?,‚Äù
    believing that founders can answer this question by using AI tools to ‚Äúcreate
    more first drafts‚Äù and increase the ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù of the work product to their vision.'

    live on the show. He explains that the company‚Äôs purpose is to use AI to bridge
    the idea-to-execution gap for people who think they have the resources, knowledge,
    and experience to build a business‚Äîin other words, to accelerate their process
    by ‚Äúput[ting] them in edit mode, not creation mode.‚Äù

- en: '**Craft effective chat experiences.** Nicholas‚Äôs advice for businesses creating
    chat experiences is to think about the first interaction with the customer because
    ‚Äúwhere you start matters, especially if what you‚Äôre trying to steer toward is
    a fixed outcome‚Äù (in Audos‚Äôs case, the customer launching a business). Audos‚Äôs
    bot asks the founder to name their ideal customer early on because Audos believes
    that it‚Äôs crucial to ‚Äúdeeply imagine who the person is that they‚Äôre going to serve.‚Äù'
  id: totrans-20
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Understand your customer.** Next, the bot asks the user about the needs and
    wants of their ideal customer. This question is aimed at giving the AI more context
    about the business idea, and prompting the user to think more deeply about the
    problem.'
  id: totrans-21
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Use AI to refine problem statements.** Audos-bot then provides the customer
    with different ‚Äúinterpretations of the problem,‚Äù which Nicholas believes to be
    important because ‚Äúif you can be very precise about the problem you‚Äôre trying
    to solve, it just makes coming up with a solution easier.‚Äù'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Troubleshoot solutions with AI.** After the customer has selected the option
    that best represents the problem they want to solve, the bot provides ‚Äúinteresting
    solution alternatives.‚Äù Audos uses AI to ‚Äúpitch a series of potential solutions,
    which are just across a bunch of different business models and solutions styles,‚Äù

    generates a custom presentation in Google Slides, which includes assets like a
    logo suggestion, pricing options, a map of the user journey, and search volume
    data for the product. The generation of this presentation is ‚Äúautomatic,‚Äù with
    a set of GPTs working in tandem to create it in ‚Äúfive or six minutes.‚Äù'

    fonts and new colors.‚Äù Nicholas adds that the user has the option of ‚Äúduplicat[ing]
    that deck‚Äù and modifying it according to their preferences.'

    Audos‚Äôs bot requests a $30 payment from the user before creating a ‚Äúset of tools
    to allow you to start to talk to your customers.‚Äù This includes a landing page
    for the business, a custom GPT to enable the user to ‚Äúacquire leads,‚Äù and assets

    customer feedback have been prepared, Audos-bot ‚Äúbacks [the user] into the hard

    questions based on the ‚Äú[needfinding](https://online.stanford.edu/needfinding-understand-customer-needs-outset)

- en: '**AI enables more people to build**. Nicholas says that ChatGPT helped him
    build Audos even though he‚Äôs a self-proclaimed coding novice. ‚ÄúI just think it''s
    magical that you can say, ‚ÄòThis is what want to do, can you write me the first
    version of a script?‚Äô and then you can plug that script in and run it and then
    just paste the error message, and slowly, but surely if you''re patient enough,
    you can get there,‚Äù he remarks.'

    functional complexity, Nicholas continues to use ChatGPT to blueprint new features.
    He takes me through a new feature they‚Äôre working on, the automation of launching
    custom GPTs for users, explaining, ‚ÄúI am in the process right now of prototyping
    that in my prototyping framework, so that I can then hand it to the real engineers‚Ä¶and
    say, Hey, can you please make this?‚Äù'

    to code, an area in which he‚Äôs relatively inexperienced, I ask him how he checks
    if ChatGPT is doing the right thing. ‚ÄúOnce you''ve made the mistake a few times,
    you can tend to be pretty smart about what the mistake is that you''re making
    and try not to make it again,‚Äù he says.'
