- en: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field
    of Natural Language Processing in recent years. Models like BERT, T5, and ChatGPT
    have demonstrated unprecedented performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, from
    text classification to machine translation. Despite their impressive performance,
    the use of LLMs remains challenging for many practitioners. The sheer size of
    these models, combined with the lack of understanding of their inner workings,
    has made it difficult for practitioners to effectively use and optimize these
    models for their specific needs.

- en: This practical guide to the use of LLMs in NLP provides an overview of the key
    concepts and techniques used in LLMs and explains how these models work and how
    they can be used for various NLP tasks. The book also covers advanced topics,
    such as fine-tuning, alignment, and information retrieval while providing practical
    tips and tricks for training and optimizing LLMs for specific NLP tasks.
