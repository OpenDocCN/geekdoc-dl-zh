    [$2 trillion in revenue in 2019](https://www.trade.gov/selectusa-professional-services-industry#:~:text=Industry%20Overview,out%20over%201.3%20million%20firms.).
    It’s a ripe playing ground for first-time entrepreneurs looking to get a business
    off the ground. Tiny, Andrew Wilkinson’s now-public software-holding company,
    started as a consultancy. So did Jason Fried’s 37 Signals, makers of Basecamp.
    If you’re a talented and motivated individual, it’s usually a lot easier to sell
    your time for money than it is to make a product.

    Despite decades of technological advancements, professional services have been

    clients.'

    by software standards. For example, Accenture, one of the largest consulting firms
    in the world, has more than 700,000 employees and did [$61 billion in revenue
    in 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture). That’s a revenue per employee
    of around $87,000\. Meta, on the other hand, has 70,000 employees and [$116 billion
    in revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms). That’s a revenue per
    employee of $1.6 million—almost 20x Accenture.

    However, there are probably hundreds of thousands of smaller professional services
    firms in the U.S. that could use AI to significantly change their revenue-to-employee
    ratio—and their margins. Over time,  certain categories of professional services
    may end up having a margin profile that’s more similar to software than it is
    to consulting.

    of different processes that occur as part of delivery to a client, you can probably

    people, you’ll probably get significantly better results.

    that take a significant amount of time—maybe crafting a proposal, or coming up
    with a good headline—and over time move to more complex processes. This is already

    without those trade-offs.'

    that their data generates. If the goal is to get people to do enough model training
    to replace themselves, then ideally, at the point at which their work is automated,
    they continue to get paid their existing salary. Because the model they’ve trained
    will be able to work with many times more clients than they would’ve been able
    to themselves, they should also participate in the upside.

    expertise. In exchange, as the models go on to do more and better work, the employees
    get paid. This could create an entire economy of people who—instead of exchanging
    their time for money—exchange their *data* for money to fledgling firms looking
    to add specific skills to their repertoire.

    tasks doesn’t get materially better with specialized data from skilled humans.
    When I brought this up with AI researcher and Notion AI lead [Linus Lee](http://twitter.com/thesephist),
    he raised two important points: 1) there may not be enough data generated by a
    small consultancy to train a model (and good data might be easier to get through
    other means), and 2) automating an agency is “a very complex, multi-objective
    task that is difficult to directly optimize the model to perform with either [RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)
    or prompting.” Basically, you can’t just train a model on “doing good work.” You’ll
    have to do a lot of work to break up the tasks into small demonstrable processes
    and collect end-to-end labeled data of all of the steps—which is hard but doable.
    Linus was optimistic about using AI to automate specific portions of the workflow
    for these kinds of tasks, though.'
