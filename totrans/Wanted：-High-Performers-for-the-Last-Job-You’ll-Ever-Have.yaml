    [$2 trillion in revenue in 2019](https://www.trade.gov/selectusa-professional-services-industry#:~:text=Industry%20Overview,out%20over%201.3%20million%20firms.).
    It’s a ripe playing ground for first-time entrepreneurs looking to get a business
    off the ground. Tiny, Andrew Wilkinson’s now-public software-holding company,
    started as a consultancy. So did Jason Fried’s 37 Signals, makers of Basecamp.
    If you’re a talented and motivated individual, it’s usually a lot easier to sell
    your time for money than it is to make a product.

    Despite decades of technological advancements, professional services have been
    more or less immune to the productivity gains that software promises. You’re trading
    your time for money, and each employee at a consultancy can only handle so many
    clients.'

    by software standards. For example, Accenture, one of the largest consulting firms
    in the world, has more than 700,000 employees and did [$61 billion in revenue
    in 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture). That’s a revenue per employee
    of around $87,000\. Meta, on the other hand, has 70,000 employees and [$116 billion
    in revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms). That’s a revenue per
    employee of $1.6 million—almost 20x Accenture.
  prefs: []

    However, there are probably hundreds of thousands of smaller professional services
    firms in the U.S. that could use AI to significantly change their revenue-to-employee
    ratio—and their margins. Over time,  certain categories of professional services
    may end up having a margin profile that’s more similar to software than it is
    to consulting.

    high-quality professional services like engineering, design, or copywriting work
    done without engaging an outside firm. But I’d bet coaxing models to produce differentiated
    high-quality output will remain a professionalized skill that involves talented
    humans in some way for a long time.

    differentiated-model outputs that allow you to offload as much of the process

    talent and incentivizing them to spend part of their time training a model might
    work.'

    of different processes that occur as part of delivery to a client, you can probably
    get a model to reproduce those demonstrations with some combination of prompting
    and fine-tuning. If the demonstrations are of extremely high quality from smart
    people, you’ll probably get significantly better results.

    that take a significant amount of time—maybe crafting a proposal, or coming up
    with a good headline—and over time move to more complex processes. This is already
    a common idea in AI circles, called [factored cognition](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/factored-cognition).

    like this today by “productizing” the work they do: reducing complex tasks into
    simple, repeatable processes that can be done by less experienced employees. But
    this always sacrifices quality and flexibility. AI might allow firms to productize
    without those trade-offs.'

    that their data generates. If the goal is to get people to do enough model training
    to replace themselves, then ideally, at the point at which their work is automated,
    they continue to get paid their existing salary. Because the model they’ve trained
    will be able to work with many times more clients than they would’ve been able
    to themselves, they should also participate in the upside.

    The job of an investor is to identify an interesting opportunity, deploy capital,

    paid when that capital produces more capital.

    expertise. In exchange, as the models go on to do more and better work, the employees
    get paid. This could create an entire economy of people who—instead of exchanging
    their time for money—exchange their *data* for money to fledgling firms looking
    to add specific skills to their repertoire.

    AI rather than allowing it to operate fully autonomously. In a world like this,

    scenario for the foreseeable future—and it’s probably desirable. Moving too quickly

    tasks doesn’t get materially better with specialized data from skilled humans.
    When I brought this up with AI researcher and Notion AI lead [Linus Lee](http://twitter.com/thesephist),
    he raised two important points: 1) there may not be enough data generated by a
    small consultancy to train a model (and good data might be easier to get through
    other means), and 2) automating an agency is “a very complex, multi-objective
    task that is difficult to directly optimize the model to perform with either [RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)
    or prompting.” Basically, you can’t just train a model on “doing good work.” You’ll
    have to do a lot of work to break up the tasks into small demonstrable processes
    and collect end-to-end labeled data of all of the steps—which is hard but doable.
    Linus was optimistic about using AI to automate specific portions of the workflow
    for these kinds of tasks, though.'
