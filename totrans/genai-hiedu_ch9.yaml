    in today’s technologically-driven society and provides a perceptive definition
    based on literature and research findings. It underscores the necessity of possessing
    foundational AI literacy, which grants individuals the essential understanding
    to navigate the modern digital landscape, regardless of their profession. However,
    the chapter posits that AI literacy cannot remain broad-brushed; it needs further
    granularity based on professional contexts. For instance, while healthcare professionals
    may grapple with life-threatening AI mistakes, business professionals might harness
    AI to shape brand perceptions. Consequently, the Dynamic AI Literacy Model (DAILM)
    for Specific Roles is introduced, proposing a layered approach to AI literacy
    tailored to specific professions. Additionally, the chapter sheds light on AI
    literacy’s importance in the broader digital literacy spectrum, with a special
    focus on AI literacy for teachers, and also evaluates various AI literacy frameworks
    from previous research.'

    in higher education, driven by advancements in GenAI. Tracing the evolution of
    assessment from its traditional roots, the chapter underscores the challenges
    and innovations brought forth in both pre-GenAI and GenAI contexts. As GenAI offers
    dynamic, adaptive assessment and feedback mechanisms, the chapter emphasises the
    paramount importance of maintaining educational principles such as authenticity,
    integrity, and genuine learning. Introducing the Six Assessment Redesign Pivotal
    Strategies (SARPS) and the AI Assessment Integration Framework, the chapter highlights
    nine distinct assessment types tailored for the GenAI era. However, a critical
    message conveyed is that GenAI should be “co-”, not replace, the human touch in
    education. The chapter concludes by advocating for a holistic, learner-centric
    approach to assessment, prioritising feedback and genuine learning experiences
    over mere grades.'

    (AI) in education, emphasising the importance of understanding regulatory principles
    like transparency, fairness, accountability, safety, and privacy across platforms
    such as ChatGPT and GenAI. The chapter explores the AI Ecological Education Policy
    Framework by Chan (2023), structured into three main dimensions – Governance,
    Operational, and Pedagogical. The Governance Dimension focuses on ethical governance,
    while the Operational Dimension examines practical implementation in university
    settings. The Pedagogical Dimension optimises teaching and learning with AI integration.
    Qualitative data enriches the chapter, offering a comprehensive perspective for
    shaping a holistic AI policy in higher education. The chapter also provides a
    review of AI policies from various global regions, and concludes by offering a
    step-by-step blueprint for establishing an AI policy within higher educational
