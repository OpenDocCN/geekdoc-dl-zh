    like anxiety or depression](https://mhanational.org/issues/2022/mental-health-america-adult-data#:~:text=Adult%20Prevalence%20of%20Mental%20Illness%20(AMI)%202022&text=19.86%25%20of%20adults%20are%20experiencing,to%20nearly%2050%20million%20Americans.).
    Anxiety and depression alone cost the economy an estimated [$1 trillion every
    year](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30432-0/fulltext#:~:text=Lost%20productivity%20as%20a%20result,US%24%201%20trillion%20each%20year.).

    a relatively well-off individual with a fake job and an open mind. It still took
    me many years—literally *years* of work—to get an accurate diagnosis and to get
    into the right treatment. And I was really trying my hardest! I was reading books,
    using apps, trying therapists, testing meds, and spending more money than I care
    to count. If therapy wasn’t a totally private HIPAA-regulated institution I’m
    pretty sure my clinicians would be building statues to commemorate my largesse.

    this week at the WWDC—a mood tracker, a mental health trend report, and psychological
    assessments you can take from your phone—is both a masterful business move *and*
    has a real shot at eventually solving the mental health crisis in America.

    something disruptive. They allow for Apple to create a massive dataset of mental
    health data that can be combined with machine learning to better assess, diagnose,
    and treat psychological issues and increase human flourishing. It could be a paradigm
    shift in how scientific research is done that affects every part of the mental
    health system.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    For example, maybe anxiety is caused by eating too many carbs. You’d do a randomized
    controlled trial where you tell a few stressed undergrads to stop eating pasta
    and measure the results against other undergrads who are eating as normal.

    and depression scores. Then they’d use AI and machine learning to predict them.
    They’d train algorithms that can predict who might eventually be diagnosed with
    an issue, can measure it when they do, can predict which treatments might work
    best, can connect them to clinicians, and even deliver basic interventions in
    certain cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you wanted to start on a path to making this a reality, you’d launch exactly
    the things that Apple just launched at the WWDC. For one, the features they launched
    already encourage users to record their mood states and use machine learning to
    help make associations to events in their lives and their biometric data. Users
    can also subsequently take psychological assessments on their phones—and though
    Apple hasn’t said this—presumably they’ll be able to associate that assessment
    with the mood states that have been recorded, and with their biometric data.

    minority of people are going to spend a ton of time tracking their emotions. And
    only people who suspect they have a serious problem are likely to take an anxiety
    or depression assessment. But, that doesn’t necessarily matter to Apple.'

    number in the millions. This is huge compared to the average clinical study in
