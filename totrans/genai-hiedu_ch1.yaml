- en: The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and the Internet
    of Things (IoT) has disrupted many industries and, likewise, has the potential
    to revolutionise the field of education. One tool that has been making waves in
    this regard is the *Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer* – best known as ChatGPT,
    a pretrained language processing model developed by OpenAI. In this chapter, we
    will first introduce the concepts of AI, Big Data, IoT and Generative AI (GenAI)
    to offer our readers a basic understanding of these technologies, providing some
    concrete examples from educational settings. To equip readers with the necessary
    knowledge to make informed decisions on incorporating AI into the classroom, this
    chapter will also go over some fundamental technical aspects of AI. We will then
    delve into why ChatGPT is a game changer for higher education, what the tool is
    capable of, and why it has suddenly gained such significant attention. This chapter
    will conclude with questions that we may have regarding the application of AI
    and ChatGPT in education.

    and shiny robots; in fact, however, the science of AI has been around for decades.
    As per the term *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* itself, it is a man-made system
    of computer-based algorithms and programmes that can perform tasks typically requiring
    human intelligence. We can find it in software programmes that we use in our everyday
    lives, from platforms like YouTube, Amazon and Taobao, Meta (Facebook), Google
    Translate, Google Maps, Microsoft Bing and more. These “intelligences” are built
    into such systems that have capabilities in image processing, speech recognition,
    decision-making, language translation, and even artificial creativity.

    think and act like humans. AI involves the development of algorithms and models
    that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based
    on said data. Advancements in electronics and computing hardware over recent years
    have allowed for huge leaps in the development of AI, enabling faster computing
    power, increased data and memory storage, and the creation of new algorithms such

    According to researchers and AI philosophers, AI has already gone through significant
    change and expansion (e.g., [Cordeschi, 2007](#ref1_11); [Shao et al., 2022](#ref1_53)),
    with new advancements continually building upon prior developments to produce
    increasingly sophisticated systems. Currently, discourse has identified three
    broad categories of AI, based on the complexity and extent of machine intelligence:
    Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and
    Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). [Figure 1.1](#fig1_1) shows the types of
    AI. While these can be considered as the evolutionary stages of AI, it should
    be noted that AGI and ASI are still theoretical concepts and not necessarily achieved
    through linear progression.'

    to perform specific tasks and are trained on large datasets to execute the tasks
    with precision, such as playing chess or translating languages. However, they
    are not capable of performing tasks that require human-level intelligence. ANI
    has helped us make numerous breakthroughs in society, such as in the domains of
    speech recognition and object recognition or detection ([LeCun et al., 2015](#ref1_29)).
    Siri, Alexa, fraud detection systems which analyse financial data for patterns
    and anomalies, as well as self-driving cars that use data from sensors, cameras
    and GPS to control vehicles, are all examples of ANI. These systems are often
    referred to as “weak AI” ([Thierer et al., 2017](#ref1_57)) as they have limited
    capabilities and lack general ‘intelligence’ due to being optimised for narrowly-defined
    tasks.'

    become capable of performing any intellectual task that humans are capable of.
    AGI refers to a hypothetical future stage of AI which “[bridges] the gap between
    current AI programs, which are narrow in scope, and the types of AGI systems commonly
    seen in fiction” ([Goertzel, 2014](#ref1_17), p.2). Unlike ANI, AGI systems will
    possess the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that we can.
    It will also have the ability to reason. Such systems would have a more general-purpose
    intelligence and not be restricted to a specific task. AGI is considered the next
    step in the evolution of AI and is often referred to as “strong AI” ([Mills, 2018](#ref1_41)).
    According to research and news articles, AI research labs and companies have not
    reached this stage of development ([Baum & Villasenor, 2023](#ref1_7); [Bove,
    2023](#ref1_9); [Gillani, 2023](#ref1_15)), but AGI is the goal of many researchers
    in the field of AI. An example of AGI could be a tool that is able to initiate
    and perform a wide range of tasks such as a teaching software that can assign
    classwork, devise schedules for students, correct classwork, coordinate with administrative
    staff, community partners, and other students, and adapt to new situations, all
    without the need for human intervention or reprogramming.'

    AI evolution ([Yampolskiy, 2016](#ref1_60)), where systems would surpass human
    intelligence in every possible aspect and possess the ability to outsmart us in
    all tasks, including higher-order thinking skills such as creativity, general
    knowledge, and problem solving. Some believe that ASI systems would have the ability
    to solve complex problems, make decisions, and even possess consciousness and
    emotions (e.g., [Barney, 2023](#ref1_6); [Marri, 2018](#ref1_34)). This type of
    sophistication is sometimes referred to as “AI singularity” ([Grossman, 2023](#ref1_18)).
    The term “singularity” in this context is borrowed from the field of physics,
    where it is used to describe a point in space-time where the rules, as we understand
    them, break down, such as at the centre of a black hole. In the context of AI,
    the singularity would represent a point where machines become so advanced that
    human minds can no longer predict or understand the former’s behaviour or implications.
    This could include AI improving its design and creating successive generations
    of increasingly powerful machines. This type of AI is still purely speculative,
    and the exact timeline for its development is unknown. However, the development
    of ASI and its impact on society raises many ethical and moral questions. ASI
    is often portrayed as a potential threat to humanity, and there are debates about
    how to ensure its safe development and deployment ([Bostrom, 2014](#ref1_8); [Yudkowsky,
    2006](#ref1_61)). When contemplating ASI, it is often associated with fictional
    depictions such as Skynet in *The Terminator*, Vision from the *Marvel* franchise,
    or the AI robot (Sonny) in *I, Robot*.'

    refers to a vast amount of data ([Favaretto et al., 2020](#ref1_14); [Kitchin
    & McArdle, 2016](#ref1_25)), but did you know that data can come in various forms,
    such as text, numbers, images, audio recordings, and videos?

- en: Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that are too complex and voluminous
    for traditional data processing systems to handle efficiently ([McAfee & Brynjolfsson,
    2012](#ref1_37)). They can be structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
    generated or retrieved from various sources, including social media, e-commerce
    platforms, sensors, government data, financial data, telecommunication and gaming
    industries, and system and software logs. Structured data is information that
    is organised in a specific and predefined format, such as tables, spreadsheets,
    and databases ([Sarker, 2021](#ref1_51)). The data is already somewhat categorised.
    Examples of structured data include customer records, financial transactions,
    and inventory lists. This type of data is easily searchable, sortable, and analysed
    using conventional data processing tools. On the other hand, unstructured data
    is information that does not fit neatly into predefined categories or structures
    ([Sarker, 2021](#ref1_51)). It often requires specialised tools and techniques
    to extract meaningful insights. Examples of unstructured data include social media
    posts, emails, and customer feedback.

    analysis. The availability of large amounts of data has allowed AI algorithms
    to learn and make predictions more accurately. With Big Data, AI models can be
    trained on larger datasets and make predictions that are more informed and reliable.
    As a result, managing, processing, and extracting insights from Big Data often
    requires specialised tools and techniques, for example data warehousing, machine
    learning, and distributed computing. Yet, it is not only the amount of data that
    is important – it is what organisations do with the data. Big Data can be analysed
    for insights which lead to better decisions and strategic moves. [Table 1.1](#table1_1)

    traits of Big Data – Volume, Velocity, and Variety ([Laney, 2001](#ref1_28)).
    These “three Vs” form a key framework which influences how organisations and researchers
    approach and use Big Data. In addition to Laney’s work, studies have suggested
    other significant characteristics, such as Veracity, Variability, and Value ([Jin

    characteristics, summarised in [Table 1.2](#table1_2), are often used to support
    organisations in making decisions regarding Big Data, and to determine the best
    ways to process, analyse, as well as extract insights from said data. [Kitchin

    student learning – has all of the above characteristics. The *volume* can refer
    to collecting and analysing large amounts of data from various sources, including
    student transcripts, test scores, demographic information, and attendance and
    engagement data from online learning platforms. The *velocity* of the data could
    refer to real-time updates of student progress and achievements on a learning
    platform. The *variety* of data sources collected can be vast, including grades,
    scores from assignments (such as reflective journals, video presentations, and
    portfolios), and data logs of student activity (such as logs from communication
    channels and attendance records). *Veracity* of the data may refer to students
    giving incorrect information with errors and typos, or missing data as students
    drop courses after a certain period of time. To address these challenges, institutions
    may use complex algorithms and models to extract insights from collected data,
    and make informed decisions for areas including student retention, curriculum
    design, and resource allocation. Integrating and analysing data from various sources
    and in different formats using innovative models may contribute to the *complexity*
    of the Big Data. *Variability* is another a concern, such as students having different
    learning paces and patterns. The *exhaustiveness* of the data is also a challenge,
    as the data collected may not capture the full picture of student performance.
    As an example, factors such as learning environment or socio-economic background
    which may influence student learning could be overlooked. The *relationality*
    of the data, such as linking students’ grades to the time of day and to the courses
    they have taken, can enable the system to provide meaningful insights. Finally,
    the *extensionality* of Big Data may refer to collection of data on students who
    fail, change programmes, undertake an overseas exchange, or take a gap year, to
    gain a more comprehensive understanding of student learning.

    new data or content ([Dilmegani, 2023](#ref1_12); [McKinsey Consultant, 2023](#ref1_38);
    [Altexsoft, 2022](#ref1_2)). The term “generative” refers to the capability of
    AI to produce novel outputs rather than simply reproducing, categorising, processing,
    and analysing inputs. It can generate anything from text, images, audio, and videos,
    to natural-language text and even computer coding.

    intelligence. One of the earliest references to such a technology can be found
    in the work of computer scientist John Hopfield in the 1980s, who proposed the
    idea of a “Hopfield network”, a type of computer neural network that could be
    trained to generate new patterns or sequences ([Kampakis, 2022](#ref1_23); [McKinsey
    Global Institute, 2018](#ref1_39)). The fields of machine learning and artificial
    neural networks have evolved over time as researchers and practitioners worked
    to develop more sophisticated generative architecture and deep learning algorithms,
    including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs),
    and transformer-based models (e.g. GPT-3 Generative Pretrained Transformer 3).
    There are two important models in GenAI: Discriminative and Generative Modelling
    ([Altexsoft, 2022](#ref1_2)).'

    to classify or categorise existing data points into specific classes or categories.
    While this model is able to distinguish the boundaries between classes, it is
    trained only to tell the differences and does not understand how data is generated.
    Machine learning tasks using this approach are classified as *supervised machine
    learning tasks*. The goal of this approach is to discriminate or make a distinction
    between the different classes, and then make predictions based on the data it
    has been trained on.'

    whether a student will pass or fail a particular exam based on their past performance,
    test scores, and attendance records. The discriminative model would look at the
    data provided, identify the differences between students who passed the exam and
    those who failed, then make predictions based on those differences. The model
    is simply trying to distinguish between students who passed and those who failed
    – it does not consider why students achieve certain outcomes, and only aims to
    make accurate predictions.

    is ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer). ChatGPT is a pretrained
    text-generation language model developed by OpenAI that uses a transformer-based
    language architecture ([Srivastava, 2022](#ref1_56); [Joshi, 2021](#ref1_22);
    [Kulshrestha, 2020](#ref1_26)), a type of deep neural network well suited for
    natural language processing tasks. It has the ability to understand and generate
    human-like text based on the input it receives. In addition, it has been trained
    on a massive amount of data which has allowed it to learn the patterns, styles,
    and complexities of human language, making it a remarkable tool for communication.
    With capabilities in language generation, translation, summarisation, and questioning
    and answering, ChatGPT has caused a huge ripple in the technological industry
    ([Zaveri, 2023](#ref1_62)).

    [Petrova, 2023](#ref1_45)); and it is knowledgeable with training from huge volumes
    of information ([Shankland, 2023](#ref1_52)). AI has been around for more than
    a decade, but recent advancements in the field have made it more accessible and
    user-friendly. With ChatGPT, OpenAI’s decision to allow public access to the software,
    its user-friendly interface, and its ability to understand and respond to natural
    language in a human-like manner, sets it apart from previous AI models. Additionally,
    the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online and virtual interactions.
    The public has grown in their awareness and acceptance of online functionality
    given their increased experiences with remote working and learning, as well as
    through the increased popularity of online financing and shopping. As a result,

    to recognise the benefits and potentials of full-time virtual learning. Before
    the pandemic, traditional, in-person teaching and learning was regarded as the
    sole, favoured, or most effective approach to education for many individuals.
    The sudden outbreak and spread of COVID-19, resulting in widespread lockdowns
    and social distancing measures, forced universities, colleges, and schools to
    close their physical campuses and transition to virtual teaching and learning.
    With the sudden shift online, many have had to adapt and embrace online education,
    leading to gradual recognition of the possibilities and capabilities such a mode
    holds for delivering high-quality education. This has also opened up new opportunities
    for utilising technology in classrooms. For example, ChatGPT is expected to play
    a significant role in the future of teaching and learning, driving education to
    develop and undertake better practices by replacing those which could be automated
    ([Jacobsen, 2023](#ref1_20)). In the post-COVID era, we are beginning to see many
    educational institutions opening up to the possibility of allowing students to
    continue their education remotely, which increases accessibility and flexibility,
    as well as creates new opportunities for learning. Even renowned universities
    such as University College London (UCL) or Kings College London are providing
    numerous pathways to go remote by offering online Masters programmes ([UCL, n.d.](#ref1_58))
    and blended options for International Foundation programmes ([King’s College London,
    n.d.](#ref1_24)). Online courses allow students to attend lectures and complete
    assignments from the comfort of their own homes, which can save time and money
    on commuting. Moreover, virtual learning environments can be designed to promote
    inclusivity, better support students with special needs, and ensure that those
    in remote areas can still access teaching and learning. The growing demand for
    online learning has also led to the increased popularity and adoption of AI-powered
    virtual assistants like ChatGPT, which can further enhance the accessibility,
    efficiency, and effectiveness of education. For instance, ChatGPT can serve as
    a 24/7 virtual assistant that offers real-time responses to students’ queries,
    provide personalised support and guidance, and provide assistance in maintaining
    learning progress.

    We should also note that the recent surge of discussion regarding AI’s impact
    on education is not necessarily late; despite the 50-year presence of AI, its
    impact on education has only gained considerable prominence with the recent advancement
    of ChatGPT. While tools like Google Translate may have made notable impacts on
    certain educational domains, its impact pales in comparison to the potentials
    of ChatGPT. With its capabilities of providing immediate and tailored feedback,
    facilitating natural language interactions, and serving as both a teaching and
    research assistant, ChatGPT and other GenAI tools have established themselves
    as a transformative force for higher education. Such technology has the potential
    to fundamentally change the way students learn while also supporting educators

    One of the key drivers behind the development of generative AI is the desire to
    elevate the creative process ([Eapen et al., 2023](#ref1_13)). By implementing
    algorithms and machine learning models, generative AI possesses the capacity to
    generate new and unique content that cannot be achieved through traditional, manual
    methods. However, the benefit of producing novel outputs also introduces potential
    drawbacks, including the risk of generating biased or unfair outputs, or content
    that is inappropriate or harmful. Several aspects are to be addressed: the need
    to strike a balance between human and machine values and control; the need to
    ensure that generated content is of high quality and relevancy; and the need to
    navigate the ethical considerations arising from the complex nature of AI. It

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For many readers, the concept of machines creating images based on textual descriptions
    might sound like science fiction. Yet, in GenAI, this has become a reality. To
    shed some light on this capability, we have crafted a high-level overview of how
    GenAI works in the context of generating images from text. Please refer to [Figure
    1.5](#fig1_5) for a visual representation. Those desiring a deeper dive can explore
    [Chapter 6](ch6.xhtml).

    interprets it as numbers. And every image is made of pixels. Each pixel has a
    colour, represented by three numbers: red, green, and blue (RGB). An image, then,
    is essentially a matrix of number trios. As you can see in [Figure 1.4](#fig1_4),
    digital images are represented by a size for example 1920 pixels × 1080 pixels.
    Each pixel represents a location on the image like x, y coordinates and then at
    each pixel there is a colour represented by three numbers for, one for the amount
    of red, another for the amount of green, and another for the amount of blue (RGB).
    This results in a matrix (array) of vectors (list of numbers) like [13,8,255,0,0]
    which can represent the whole image.'

    generation software is trained on vast visual and textual datasets. Think of it
    as an artist with an encyclopedic knowledge of styles, subjects, and scenes. This
    can range from simplistic drawings to intricate photographs.

    visuals. It begins to understand that the word “sunset” might evoke hues of orange
    and pink, or that a “snowy mountain” corresponds to white peaks against a clear
    sky.

- en: One approach to GenAI’s capability is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
    This involves a duo – a generator (the artist) and a discriminator (the critic).
    The artist generates, and the critic evaluates. Over time, the generator gets
    better at producing images that can pass the discriminator’s critique. [Figure
    1.5](#fig1_5) shows how text is prompted and generated into image.

    create the image. Diffusion is a technique to make images fuzzy. This fuzzy appearance
    is similar to static on old televisions, often referred to as “noise”. Noise is
    merely random colours/pixels. You can make an image noisy by adding random numbers
    to its pixels. Conversely, to clarify a noisy image, you adjust the random numbers
    so they produce a coherent image. In this step, the generator then produces an
    image that corresponds to the textual description as shown in [Figure 1.6](#fig1_6).![The
    diffusion process is shown with a series of images that is clear at first and
