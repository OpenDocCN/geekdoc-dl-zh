- en: This is a familiar sentiment—C nerds used to sniff about how Python programmers
    aren’t real programmers because they don’t have to do memory management. C nerds
    were definitely right in certain ways. It is true that learning to do memory management
    makes you a better programmer. But do today’s Python programmers truly need it?
    Probably not.

  zh: 这是一个熟悉的情感——C 程序员过去常常嗤之以鼻地说 Python 程序员不是真正的程序员，因为他们不必进行内存管理。在某些方面，C 程序员确实是对的。学习进行内存管理确实会使你成为更好的程序员。但是今天的
    Python 程序员真的需要吗？可能不需要。
- en: I think the same is true in the case of using AI to help you program. It makes
    a world of difference to have a deep understanding of underlying programming concepts
    when you’re prompting the model to help you build things.

  zh: 我认为在使用 AI 帮助你编程的情况下也是如此。当你提示模型帮助你构建东西时，对底层编程概念有深入的理解会带来很大的不同。
- en: But AI can be an effective tool to help you motivate yourself to get that understanding.
    And, as models improve, you may not need nearly as much understanding of the fundamental
    implementation details as you did 20 years ago.

- en: I had to sit in my bedroom and manually type instructions from the book into
    my computer. When something didn’t work, I had to pray that the answer was somewhere
    in the text. If it wasn’t, I’d have to hunt through janky vBulletin forum posts
    and hope to pick up the scent of someone who’d solved a similar problem. It was
    very frustrating, and very time-consuming. It probably took me 6 months to fully
    understand what was in it.
