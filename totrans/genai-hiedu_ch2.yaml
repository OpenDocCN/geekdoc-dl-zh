    and between humans and machines, but also provides a range of interaction mediums
    and channels including text-based, graphical, audio, video, and even coding-based
    responses. As AI technology continues to advance, its integration into various
    domains of society becomes even more prevalent – we now see AI’s influence in
    many corners of our lives, whether in personalised online shopping recommendations
    or social media content that we scroll through on our screens. For instance, consider
    how AI algorithms on platforms like Netflix or YouTube influence what we watch
    by recommending new shows or videos ([Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014](#ref2_3)).
    It has become a steady companion, subtly shaping our interactions, choices, and
    societal structures, making it even more essential for individuals to develop
    a foundational comprehension of its capabilities and limitations ([Casal-Otero
    et al., 2023](#ref2_6)). Cultivating AI literacy allows people to better understand
    the underlying mechanisms driving these systems, identify potential biases, and
    contribute to the continuous dialogue about the ethical and social implications
    of AI technology. And, the forthcoming AI-Native Generation, will be the first
    to have never lived in a world without AI technology.

    world, especially for students and teachers in higher education. Simply put, AI
    literacy is about knowing how AI works and how to use it wisely and ethically.
    It is not just about being tech-savvy; it is about understanding AI’s impact,
    making smart choices, and being aware of the ethical issues that it raises. For
    students and teachers in higher education, being AI literate is crucial as AI
    is becoming a big part of learning, research, and administration in universities.
    We will look at what experts have said about AI literacy, explore its meaning,
    why it is needed, and how it can be developed, with a special focus on its role
    in higher education. The upcoming sections shall dissect existing literature and
    studies, shedding light on the conceptualisations, necessities, and implementations
    of AI literacy, thereby enriching our understanding and scaffolding future pathways
    for effective integration of AI in educational paradigms.

    govern privacy, decision-making, and socio-economic dynamics, underlining the
    criticality of understanding its mechanics, applications, and implications. AI
    literacy, therefore, serves as a pivotal tool in demystifying the complexities
    and intricacies embedded within technological systems and algorithms. Being AI
    literate does not only help us use technology better – it also improves our ability
    to check, question, and guide how the digital world grows. By understanding what
    AI can and cannot do, people can make smarter choices, plan better, and have important
    discussions about how technology is used and controlled. As AI becomes a bigger
    part of our daily lives, it is crucial for everyone to have a basic understanding
    of it.

    as important. Although much attention is often placed on providing students with
    essential AI skills, it is vital to acknowledge that teachers, serving as the
    main conduits of learning, also need proficiency in utilising AI. For students,
    it is about cultivating a skill set that is synchronously technical and critical,
    preparing them not only for existing job markets, but also equipping them to ethically,
    strategically, and innovatively navigate future landscapes that will undoubtedly
    be even more densely interwoven with technology. For educators and administrators,
    AI literacy is pivotal for astute policy formulation, ensuring that governance
    and regulatory frameworks are effective in addressing the intricacies and ethical
    conundrums of implementing AI technologies in academic contexts. Furthermore,
    a solid understanding of AI is vital in strategic resource allocation, enhancing
    institutional operations and creating forward-thinking educational experiences.
    This helps both the institution and its community keep up with the fast-paced
    changes in our digital and AI-driven world. However, it may be tough for some
    educators to develop new competencies like AI literacy; certainly, the journey
    for them to shift their mindsets and acquire such skills might pose its own set
    of challenges. As such, policymakers should also think about these issues and
    be mindful in addressing them.

    & Allen, 2018](#ref2_33)), numerous AI training programmes have been established
    to equip the workforce with more in-depth knowledge ([Bughin et al., 2018](#ref2_5);
    [Chan, 2023; Kong et al., 2021](#ref2_19)). Various companies have launched AI
    learning and skill enhancement initiatives ([Vinuesa et al., 2020](#ref2_31))
    to widely educate employees and bridge the growing skills divide. Programmes designed
    for children have also demonstrated that even those as young as 10 years old can
    grasp fundamental concepts and utilise them in inventive ways to address issues
    in their communities ([Kahn & Winters, 2017](#ref2_16); [Wolfram, 2017](#ref2_36)).
    All these AI training endeavours necessitate a foundational literacy in AI among
    us. But what is AI literacy? What does it constitute?

    the progression and expansion of technology and information access ([Buckingham,
    1993](#ref2_4)). Initially, information literacy was crucial, providing a basis
    for effectively discerning and utilising rapidly growing and accessible information,
    particularly in the context of library and research environments. Then, as different
    technological epochs unfolded, several other literacies were coined, branching
    out to cater to the demands and challenges posed by new media and technologies.
    From understanding the implications of media messages and navigating the digital
    world, to deciphering data and interacting with AI, each type of literacy is constructed
    upon those previous, together weaving a tapestry that shows the multidimensional
    competencies needed in our current information age. Below, we put together some
    of the common literacies used in the digital world. Highlights can be found in

    prominent as a focus of study and discussion in the latter part of the century,
    following the rise of mass media. Media literacy involves understanding, analysing,
    and creating media, which includes not only traditional media like newspapers,
    film, and television, but also digital media like social media and online content.
    This literacy involves understanding and analysing media content critically, using
    a discerning eye to evaluate its creation, purpose, and message. Various scholars
    and organisations have contributed to the concept, but one notably significant
    contributor is Sonia Livingstone. In her 2004 paper ([Livingstone, 2004](#ref2_25))
    titled “What is media literacy?”, she defines media literacy as “the ability to
    access, analyse, evaluate, and create messages across a variety of contexts” (p.

    emerging notion of “AI literacy”, seeking a robust theoretical underpinning to
    define, teach, and evaluate it. Grounded on the analysis of 30 peer-reviewed articles,
    AI literacy is conceptualised within a framework comprised of four key aspects:
    knowing and understanding AI, applying AI, evaluating and creating with AI, and
    addressing AI ethics. The first three of these four aspects are also mapped onto
    Bloom’s Taxonomy ([Bloom et al., 1956](#ref2_1); [Huitt, 2011](#ref2_15)), to
    further conceptualise that they are successively attained. The authors also highlighted
    the ever-growing need of AI literacy in today’s day and age, comparing it to how
    classic literacies (e.g., in reading, writing, mathematics) have already extended
    to include digital literacy given the advancement of computer technologies. Moreover,
    Ng et al.’s framework encourages a comprehensive understanding of AI, extending
    beyond mere utilisation to encompassing basic functions, ethical usage, and application
    in varied scenarios. The “know and understand AI” aspect emphasises acquiring
    fundamental AI concepts and recognising the underlying technologies in everyday
    AI applications. The “apply AI” facet underscores the importance of deploying
    AI knowledge in different contexts, enhancing practical comprehension. “Evaluate
    & create AI” encourages engaging in higher-order thinking activities, promoting
    critical evaluation and creative interactions with AI technologies. Lastly, the
    “AI ethics” dimension highlights human-centred considerations like fairness, accountability,
    transparency, and ethics, aiming to foster socially responsible AI usage. This
    structured approach facilitates a multi-dimensional understanding of AI literacy,

    continues to be deeply integrated into daily life. The cognitive dimension emphasises
    the education of basic AI concepts to individuals, cultivating their foundational

    of organisational and digital workplaces. Based on their scoping review, AI literacy
    is conceptualised as a bundle of four core capabilities: technology-related, work-related,
    human-machine-related, and learning-related. The technology-related capabilities
    are foundational as AI literacy is rooted in technology, encompassing elements
    like data availability, technological infrastructure, and technical skills which
    are vital for utilising AI in various domains (e.g., one’s ability to collect
    and analyse data). Work-related capabilities enable effective AI implementation
    in the workplace, and includes a range of competencies such as ethical considerations
    for AI usage, critical thinking, problem solving, and communication skills, all
    of which support complex cognitive and decision-making tasks. Human-machine-related
    capabilities focuses on enhancing and leveraging the collaboration between humans
    and AI, emphasising the need for geometric reasoning, situational assessment,
    human-aware task planning, and increasing the explainability of AI to foster genuine
    human–machine interactions. Lastly, learning-related capabilities refer to the
    importance of continuous lifelong learning to keep up with the rapidly evolving
    and volatile digital landscape. This entails fostering self-learning abilities,
    managerial skills, problem solving, and other soft skills to ensure responsible
    usage of digital technologies and facilitate skills development that align with

    of AI can be extremely context-dependent. To effectively prepare the future workforce,
    it is therefore essential to not only explore generic AI literacy that all individuals

    necessary for a person’s role or profession (for example, for teachers). Stated
    differently, the AI literacy that an individual should possess encompasses both
    the foundational AI literacy level explained above ([Table 2.2](#table2_2)), as

    dissection, especially to consider how different professional contexts alter what
    individuals need to know and do when interacting with AI. [Talagala (2021)](#ref2_30)
    emphasises this point of considering ‘context,’ which becomes even more salient
    when thinking about how different sectors may use and be affected by AI – for
    applications in healthcare for example, errors could be life-threatening, while
    in business, AI might be used to influence brand image and reputation.

    varies. This means that a layered approach to AI literacy – where we consider
    the necessary level of literacy (high, medium, or low) in each of the framework’s
    five components, as required for specific professions and roles – would enable
    the foundational framework to be more holistic and applicable. This expanded framework
    is the Dynamic AI Literacy Model (DAILM) for Specific Roles, as shown in [Figure

    a general practitioner in the medical field. While the former will likely need
    a high level of literacy across all five aspects of the foundational framework,
    particularly in order to programme AI systems themselves, the latter may not need
    the same level or depth of mastery across the five components. A general practitioner’s
    needs and interactions with AI are different – perhaps they will focus primarily
    on a medium level in AI’s applications, AI’s affectiveness for human emotions,
    safety, and responsible usage. The practitioner would not need the same extent
    of in-depth knowledge about the creation and development of AI systems (i.e.,
    a low level of literacy in this is adequate) to still be able to interact effectively
    and responsibly with the AI technologies they commonly encounter in their context.

    what AI systems are, but also actively innovate, develop, and review new AI systems
    and programmes. They would need a distinctly high level of literacy across the
    five aspects of the foundational framework, so that they can deep-dive into advanced
    concepts and applications, including algorithmic biases and data privacy laws.
    Their need to carefully make ethical considerations in system design and deployment
    further elevates their need for high literacy in recognising responsible AI usage
    and safety and security issues. In addition, programmers can develop AI systems
    that can understand and respond to human emotions. This can lead to more personalised
    and engaging user experiences, as the AI can adapt its behavior and responses
    based on the user’s emotions, leading to improved user satisfaction and engagement.

    its integration into diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient data management.
    Therefore, while a medium to high literacy level in AI applications, affectiveness,
    safety, and data security would be needed to ensure accurate and ethical patient
    care, an in-depth understanding of AI concepts may not be as critical, thus only
    requiring a low to medium level of literacy in this aspect for this specific role.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The contrast between these two roles highlights a key consideration: the need
    for an additional factor in the foundational AI Literacy Framework, where specific
    aspects are highlighted and others de-emphasised, based on the professional context.
    Any new context or role-specific aspects can also be integrated as necessary,
    allowing flexibility for industries to each define AI literacy as per their standards
    of practice. Hence, developing a multi-faceted, level-based AI literacy framework,
    which incorporates the five core aspects and introduces role-specific additions
    or expansions, would significantly enhance the applicability and value of AI literacy
    across different professional fields.'

    for general understanding and engagement with AI technologies, a multi-dimensional,
    context-specific, and level-based extension of its five aspects is imperative
    to truly cater to the varied, nuanced needs of different professionals in their
    respective fields. The proposed enhanced framework, the DAILM for Specific Roles,
    not only aligns with the multi-dimensionality of real-world AI applications, but
    also fortifies AI users’ capacity to interact, innovate, and ethically engage
    with these technologies in a manner that is pragmatically embedded in their specific

    be regulated. This will help to ensure that technologies are developed and implemented
    in ways that are beneficial for all.

    platforms, AI literacy fosters responsible and informed digital citizenship. Understanding
    AI helps individuals to interact wisely and ethically with digital platforms,
    recognise misinformation, and engage productively in online environments.

- en: As we journey through the vast and still much-uncharted world of AI, it is clear
    that getting to grips with AI literacy is not just helpful, but crucial, particularly
    for the upcoming generations. As our world becomes increasingly digitalised, learning
    about AI is now a must in our daily, educational, and professional lives. AI is
    more than a tool – it is a force that changes the way we interact, create, and
    think.

- en: However, developing AI literacy across the board does come with its own set
    of challenges that need careful thought and strategic planning. One major hurdle
    is how resource-intensive AI education can be. Making sure educational programmes
    are both in-depth enough and accessible will require a lot of time, money, and
    expertise, putting a strain on resources especially in areas or institutions that
    may not have a lot to spare ([West, 2018](#ref2_32)). Additionally, there is a
    risk of becoming overly dependent on AI, which may consequently result in the
    subtle and valuable aspects of human decision-making being overlooked or ignored
    ([Bostrom, 2014](#ref2_2); [Chan & Hu, 2023](#ref2_11)). An example of this is
    if an individual over-relies on GPS for navigation and ignores developing their
    natural sense of direction and spatial awareness; another is if in education,
    a student relies too much on GenAI tools to summarise and write, eventually losing
    their fundamental ability and skills to do so themselves.

- en: At a further layer, differences in socio-economic status also stand as a considerable
    obstacle for achieving universal AI literacy. There is a real risk of increasing
    the “digital divide”, where those with fewer resources and greater difficultly
    in accessing technology get left behind, unable to fully engage with or benefit
    from our digital world ([Eubanks, 2018](#ref2_13)). Furthermore, because AI is
    always evolving, it requires a culture of constant learning and adaptation. While
    instilling such a culture is essentially a good thing, it can also bring pressures
    and challenges, such as in keeping up with the continual influx of technological
    advancements ([Crawford & Calo, 2016](#ref2_12)).

- en: Finally, potential misconduct and security vulnerabilities are also looming
    concerns. It is possible that self-serving individuals may use their mastery of
    AI literacy to manipulate or exploit AI systems, introducing a whole range of
    ethical and practical challenges ([Zuboff, 2019](#ref2_37)). For example, hackers
    may manipulate AI algorithms or data to their advantage; there may also be risks
    of identity theft or scams carried out through the use of advanced deep-fake AI
    technologies.

- en: Thus, as we work towards establishing universal AI literacy, combining its benefits
    and navigating through the challenges, it is key to ensure that we do so in ways
    that are balanced, inclusive, and critically reflective. Incorporating AI literacy
    as an essential part of our future will demand a united, thoughtful, and ethical
    approach to ensure AI’s benefits can be accessed by all and that its challenges
    are carefully and effectively managed.

- en: AI literacy, as we have explored throughout this chapter, isn’t just a technical
    skill – it is vital for us to navigate effectively through our increasingly AI-driven
    world, and especially in higher education. From making informed decisions to understanding
    the ripple effects of technology in our lives and societies, becoming AI-literate
    shapes our approach to ethical, strategic, and innovative thinking. The journey
    through the different domains of AI literacy is not simply about just understanding
    mechanics; it further involves guiding the ethical and inclusive development and
    application of AI itself, in our daily lives and educational systems. The Foundational
    AI Literacy Framework serves as vital guide in this journey, offering structure
    in navigating the complexities of AI and emphasising the essential components
    of understanding AI concepts, its applications, affectiveness for human emotions,
    safety, and responsible usage. Meanwhile, the Dynamic AI Literacy Model (DAILM)
    takes it a step further by integrating a role-specific approach, recognising the
    multi-faceted interactions and ethical considerations across various professional
    fields. Together, these frameworks not only fortify general and professional AI
    literacy, but also ensure that individuals and professionals interact with AI
    technologies in a manner that is informed, ethical, and deeply embedded in their
    specific contexts. The synthesis of foundational knowledge and role-specific literacy
    via the DAILM shapes a future where technology is not an enigma but an ally, safeguarding
    ethical, innovative, and responsible progression in the AI-driven era.
