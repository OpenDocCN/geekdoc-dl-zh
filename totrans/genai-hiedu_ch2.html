<h2 id="sec2_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">2.1 </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) not only facilitates communication between humans and between humans and machines, but also provides a range of interaction mediums and channels including text-based, graphical, audio, video, and even coding-based responses. As AI technology continues to advance, its integration into various domains of society becomes even more prevalent &#x2013; we now see AI&#x2019;s influence in many corners of our lives, whether in personalised online shopping recommendations or social media content that we scroll through on our screens. For instance, consider how AI algorithms on platforms like Netflix or YouTube influence what we watch by recommending new shows or videos (<a href="#ref2_3" id="R_ref2_3" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Brynjolfsson &#x0026; McAfee, 2014</a>). It has become a steady companion, subtly shaping our interactions, choices, and societal structures, making it even more essential for individuals to develop a foundational comprehension of its capabilities and limitations (<a href="#ref2_6" id="R_ref2_6" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Casal-Otero et al., 2023</a>). Cultivating AI literacy allows people to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving these systems, identify potential biases, and contribute to the continuous dialogue about the ethical and social implications of AI technology. And, the forthcoming AI-Native Generation, will be the first to have never lived in a world without AI technology.</p>
<p>This chapter explores the importance of understanding AI in today&#x2019;s digital world, especially for students and teachers in higher education. Simply put, AI literacy is about knowing how AI works and how to use it wisely and ethically. It is not just about being tech-savvy; it is about understanding AI&#x2019;s impact, making smart choices, and being aware of the ethical issues that it raises. For students and teachers in higher education, being AI literate is crucial as AI is becoming a big part of learning, research, and administration in universities. We will look at what experts have said about AI literacy, explore its meaning, why it is needed, and how it can be developed, with a special focus on its role in higher education. The upcoming sections shall dissect existing literature and studies, shedding light on the conceptualisations, necessities, and implementations of AI literacy, thereby enriching our understanding and scaffolding future pathways for effective integration of AI in educational paradigms.</p></section>

<h2 id="sec2_2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p25" aria-label=" page 25. " role="doc-pagebreak"/><span epub:type="ordinal">2.2 </span>The Importance of AI Literacy</h2>
<p>The potentials and pitfalls of AI use are expansive, encompassing aspects that govern privacy, decision-making, and socio-economic dynamics, underlining the criticality of understanding its mechanics, applications, and implications. AI literacy, therefore, serves as a pivotal tool in demystifying the complexities and intricacies embedded within technological systems and algorithms. Being AI literate does not only help us use technology better &#x2013; it also improves our ability to check, question, and guide how the digital world grows. By understanding what AI can and cannot do, people can make smarter choices, plan better, and have important discussions about how technology is used and controlled. As AI becomes a bigger part of our daily lives, it is crucial for everyone to have a basic understanding of it.</p>
<p>Within educational environments, the significance of AI literacy is equally as important. Although much attention is often placed on providing students with essential AI skills, it is vital to acknowledge that teachers, serving as the main conduits of learning, also need proficiency in utilising AI. For students, it is about cultivating a skill set that is synchronously technical and critical, preparing them not only for existing job markets, but also equipping them to ethically, strategically, and innovatively navigate future landscapes that will undoubtedly be even more densely interwoven with technology. For educators and administrators, AI literacy is pivotal for astute policy formulation, ensuring that governance and regulatory frameworks are effective in addressing the intricacies and ethical conundrums of implementing AI technologies in academic contexts. Furthermore, a solid understanding of AI is vital in strategic resource allocation, enhancing institutional operations and creating forward-thinking educational experiences. This helps both the institution and its community keep up with the fast-paced changes in our digital and AI-driven world. However, it may be tough for some educators to develop new competencies like AI literacy; certainly, the journey for them to shift their mindsets and acquire such skills might pose its own set of challenges. As such, policymakers should also think about these issues and be mindful in addressing them.</p>
<p>While the broader public possesses only a limited understanding of AI (<a href="#ref2_33" id="R_ref2_33" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">West &#x0026; Allen, 2018</a>), numerous AI training programmes have been established to equip the workforce with more in-depth knowledge (<a href="#ref2_5" id="R_ref2_5" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Bughin et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref2_19" id="R_ref2_19" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chan, 2023; Kong et al., 2021</a>). Various companies have launched AI learning and skill enhancement initiatives (<a href="#ref2_31" id="R_ref2_31" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Vinuesa et al., 2020</a>) to widely educate employees and bridge the growing skills divide. Programmes designed for children have also demonstrated that even those as young as 10 years old can grasp fundamental concepts and utilise them in inventive ways to address issues in their communities (<a href="#ref2_16" id="R_ref2_16" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kahn &#x0026; Winters, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref2_36" id="R_ref2_36" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Wolfram, 2017</a>). All these AI training endeavours necessitate a foundational literacy in AI among us. But what is AI literacy? What does it constitute?</p></section>

<h2 id="sec2_3"><span epub:type="ordinal">2.3 </span>Literacy in the Digital World</h2>
<p>The history of various literacies reveals a fascinating evolution that reflects the progression and expansion of technology and information access (<a href="#ref2_4" id="R_ref2_4" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Buckingham, 1993</a>). Initially, information literacy was crucial, providing a basis for effectively discerning and utilising rapidly growing and accessible information, particularly in the context of library and research environments. Then, as different technological epochs unfolded, several other literacies were coined, branching out to cater to the demands and challenges posed by new media <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p26" aria-label=" page 26. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>and technologies. From understanding the implications of media messages and navigating the digital world, to deciphering data and interacting with AI, each type of literacy is constructed upon those previous, together weaving a tapestry that shows the multidimensional competencies needed in our current information age. Below, we put together some of the common literacies used in the digital world. Highlights can be found in <a href="#table2_1" id="R_table2_1">Table 2.1</a>.</p>

<p><b><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p27" aria-label=" page 27. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>Information Literacy</b> is often considered as a foundational literacy. Its roots stretch back several decades, with Paul Zurkowski, President of the Information Industry Association, coining the term in <a href="#ref2_38" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>. It pertains to the ability to recognise when information is needed and to have the capability to locate, evaluate, and use such information effectively, usually within the context of research and decision-making. It forms the base from which other literacies are built upon. In a complex and often-cluttered information landscape, the skills to distinguish reliable from unreliable information and to use this information ethically and legally is imperative (<a href="#ref2_8" id="R_ref2_8" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chan, 2021</a>).</p>
<p><b>Media Literacy</b>, while having origins in the mid-20th century, became more prominent as a focus of study and discussion in the latter part of the century, following the rise of mass media. Media literacy involves understanding, analysing, and creating media, which includes not only traditional media like newspapers, film, and television, but also digital media like social media and online content. This literacy involves understanding and analysing media content critically, using a discerning eye to evaluate its creation, purpose, and message. Various scholars and organisations have contributed to the concept, but one notably significant contributor is Sonia Livingstone. In her 2004 paper (<a href="#ref2_25" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Livingstone, 2004</a>) titled &#x201C;What is media literacy?&#x201D;, she defines media literacy as &#x201C;the ability to access, analyse, evaluate, and create messages across a variety of contexts&#x201D; (p. 18). Livingstone&#x2019;s four-component model that comprises these abilities further emphasises that they are applicable to both traditional media and new forms of digital media, such as those mentioned above.</p>
<p><b>Digital Literacy</b>, as coined by Paul Gilster in his 1997 book <i>Digital Literacy</i>, encompasses not only a practical understanding of how to use digital tools and platforms, but also a deeper understanding of how to navigate the digital information space, evaluate content, and participate effectively in digital networks (<a href="#ref2_14" id="R_ref2_14" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Gilster, 1997</a>). He defines digital literacy as &#x201C;the ability to understand and use information in multiple formats from a wide variety of sources when it is presented via computers&#x201D;, particularly through the medium of the Internet (Gilster, as cited in <a href="#ref2_29" id="R_ref2_29" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Pool, 1997</a>, p. 6).</p>
<p><b>Data Literacy</b>, meanwhile, became a point of focus with the advent of the Big Data era in the early 21st century. It was brought into focus by <a href="#ref2_35" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Wolff et al. (2016)</a> and underscores the significance of understanding and interpreting data. Data literacy refers to the ability to read, understand, create, and communicate data as information. It includes the aptitude to interpret, construct, and determine the quality of data, which further enables us to analyse and evaluate the data in a meaningful way. For example, by understanding what data means and recognising patterns and trends, we are better able to make informed decisions based on data analysis. With data becoming an essential aspect of organisational and societal decision-making, data literacy is vital for making sense of the large volumes of information and utilising it effectively in various contexts. In terms of frameworks for data literacy, there are several key components that are often highlighted:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Data Exploration: This involves understanding the purpose or the &#x201C;why&#x201D; of the data.</li>
<li>Data Management: This encompasses acquiring and appropriately storing relevant data.</li>
<li>Data Use: This pertains to the analysis, interpretation, reporting, etc., of data to fulfil the intended purpose.</li></ol>
<p><b>Computational Literacy</b>, or computational thinking, emphasises problem-solving processes and involves formulating problems and their solutions in ways that computers can also execute. It emerged as a crucial skill in the context of computing and programming <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p28" aria-label=" page 28. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>education. Jeanette M. Wing, in her popular 2006 paper (<a href="#ref2_34" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Wing, 2006</a>), was pivotal in bringing this term into the broader discourse, underscoring the importance of computational thinking in problem solving across various disciplines.</p>
<p><b>AI literacy</b> was coined in an online article published in 2015 (<a href="#ref2_22" id="R_ref2_22" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Konishi, 2015</a>) and subsequently adopted in an empirical study (<a href="#ref2_17" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kandlhofer et al., 2016</a>). However, there is currently no widely accepted definition of AI literacy, with research on this subject still in its nascent stages. There is a pressing need to refine what AI literacy involves and determine what knowledge, skills, and so on are needed by individuals with no expert knowledge in this domain (<a href="#ref2_23" id="R_ref2_23" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Laupichler et al., 2022</a>). On the whole, the core idea of AI literacy revolves around empowering individuals to critically analyse, effectively interact with, and utilise AI technologies, even if they don&#x2019;t know how to create AI models themselves. The metamorphosis of AI literacy mirrors that of traditional literacy, evolving from rudimentary understanding to nuanced comprehension in higher educational echelons. The effort to define AI literacy has led to the creation of a number of frameworks and definitions that aim to capture what it means to be AI literate.</p></section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec2_4">
<h2 id="sec2_4"><span epub:type="ordinal">2.4 </span>AI Literacy Frameworks</h2>
<p>The concept of AI literacy is quite new. Especially with AI tools like ChatGPT only becoming publicly available since November 2022, research in this area is still very much in its infancy. Much of the work done so far was published between 2019 to 2022, before the introduction of ChatGPT and GenAI. Many of these studies focused on reviewing existing literature on AI literacy, for example: <a href="#ref2_23" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Laupichler et al. (2022)</a> looked at 30 studies on AI literacy in higher and adult education; <a href="#ref2_7" id="R_ref2_7" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Cetindamar et al. (2022)</a> analysed 270 articles to explore AI literacy among employees in digital workplaces; and <a href="#ref2_28" id="R_ref2_28" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Ng et al. (2021)</a> reviewed 30 articles to try and define AI literacy. All aimed to establish a solid foundation for teaching and evaluating this literacy, yet, despite these scholarly pursuits, a universally accepted framework or definition of AI literacy is still lacking. Existing literature has offered various definitions and frameworks for AI literacy, some of which we will discuss below.</p>
<p><a href="#ref2_17" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kandlhofer et al. (2016)</a> have proposed their own AI education framework, drawing analogies with classic literacies like in reading and writing, and targeting a spectrum of educational levels from kindergarten to university. Their approach aimed to define key AI literacy topics and carefully craft an educational concept inclusive of specific content, structures, and applied learning methodologies from basic to more complex forms as students progress through different educational levels. Empirical evaluation through four proof-of-concept projects showcased promising preliminary results. For instance, kindergarteners engaged playfully with fundamental AI concepts, while high schoolers achieved a solid understanding of AI literacy topics. However, middle school students struggled to correlate basic AI understanding with real-life applications, suggesting that curriculum refinement may be necessary. The study acknowledges its limitations with its small participant samples (barring at the university level) and the absence of implementation at the primary school level, which hinders broader generalisation of findings.</p>
<p>Based on their interdisciplinary exploratory review of literature, <a href="#ref2_26" id="R_ref2_26" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Long and Magerko (2020)</a> defined AI literacy as &#x201C;a set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies, communicate and collaborate effectively with AI, and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace&#x201D;. This definition emerged from their efforts to develop a conceptual framework to provide crucial guidelines for the development of AI literacy. In this framework are several design considerations proposed for supporting AI <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p29" aria-label=" page 29. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>developers and educators in creating learner-centred AI environments, such as promoting transparency in AI design and encouraging critical thinking among learners.</p>
<p><a href="#ref2_28" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Ng et al. (2021)</a> conducted an exploratory review to delineate the emerging notion of &#x201C;AI literacy&#x201D;, seeking a robust theoretical underpinning to define, teach, and evaluate it. Grounded on the analysis of 30 peer-reviewed articles, AI literacy is conceptualised within a framework comprised of four key aspects: knowing and understanding AI, applying AI, evaluating and creating with AI, and addressing AI ethics. The first three of these four aspects are also mapped onto Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy (<a href="#ref2_1" id="R_ref2_1" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Bloom et al., 1956</a>; <a href="#ref2_15" id="R_ref2_15" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Huitt, 2011</a>), to further conceptualise that they are successively attained. The authors also highlighted the ever-growing need of AI literacy in today&#x2019;s day and age, comparing it to how classic literacies (e.g., in reading, writing, mathematics) have already extended to include digital literacy given the advancement of computer technologies. Moreover, Ng et al.&#x2019;s framework encourages a comprehensive understanding of AI, extending beyond mere utilisation to encompassing basic functions, ethical usage, and application in varied scenarios. The &#x201C;know and understand AI&#x201D; aspect emphasises acquiring fundamental AI concepts and recognising the underlying technologies in everyday AI applications. The &#x201C;apply AI&#x201D; facet underscores the importance of deploying AI knowledge in different contexts, enhancing practical comprehension. &#x201C;Evaluate &#x0026; create AI&#x201D; encourages engaging in higher-order thinking activities, promoting critical evaluation and creative interactions with AI technologies. Lastly, the &#x201C;AI ethics&#x201D; dimension highlights human-centred considerations like fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics, aiming to foster socially responsible AI usage. This structured approach facilitates a multi-dimensional understanding of AI literacy, bridging theoretical insights with practical applications and ethical considerations, laying a foundation for future educational strategies, competency development, and assessment criteria in AI literacy.</p>
<p>In <a href="#ref2_21" id="R_ref2_21" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kong and Zhang&#x2019;s (2021)</a> conference paper, they present a three-dimensional conceptual framework for fostering AI literacy, structured around cognitive, affective, and sociocultural dimensions, tailored for citizens in the digital age as AI technology continues to be deeply integrated into daily life. The cognitive dimension emphasises the education of basic AI concepts to individuals, cultivating their foundational understanding, competencies, and application of AI technologies to evaluate and comprehend real-world scenarios. The affective dimension focuses on empowering individuals and equipping them with the ability to adapt, react, and respond effectively to the growing influence of AI in various facets of their lives. The sociocultural dimension encourages and promotes ethical considerations and utilisations of AI to foster a culture of responsible AI usage that aligns with sustainable global development and other broader societal and global objectives. Through this framework, the authors aspire to initiate discussions and guide future research towards the design of AI literacy programmes. They envision that their proposed framework will serve as a robust foundation for researchers, educators, and policymakers in their endeavours to nurture and engage educated citizens.</p>
<p><a href="#ref2_24" id="R_ref2_24" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Liu and Xie (2021)</a> delve into the impact of AI in education, focusing on university students in China undergoing training as primary and secondary school teachers. According to this conference paper, the integration of AI technology into education is bound to significantly alter traditional teaching ideologies and methodologies, ushering in a new era where human&#x2013;machine cooperation will be the norm, and lifelong, ubiquitous learning will become mainstream. The authors argue that programming skills are indispensable to AI literacy, further proposing a framework of three core aspects of AI literacy: Digital Literacy, Computational Thinking, and Programming Ability. The framework promotes a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p30" aria-label=" page 30. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>multi-level approach (basic ability, deepening application, and application innovation) as a strategy to cultivate university students&#x2019; ability to effectively utilise and apply AI, based on both their learning process and the advancement of AI education technology. However, the paper does not provide a concise definition of AI literacy nor detailed information on the methodology or process used to develop the framework.</p>
<p><a href="#ref2_18" id="R_ref2_18" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Karaca et al. (2021)</a> veer slightly off the conventional discourse on AI literacy and introduce the notion of &#x201C;AI readiness&#x201D;, which refers to the perceived preparedness of individuals, particularly students, to engage with AI in professional settings. Situated in the disciplinary nexus of medical education and data science, the authors developed a psychometric tool through first generating an item pool (via an extensive literature review, expert opinions and review) followed by establishing validity and reliability of the scale (through both Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis). The final tool was a 22-item scale housed within a four-factor structure (cognition, ability, vision, and ethics) that measured medical students&#x2019; perceived readiness for AI technologies and its applicability in medicine. The scale&#x2019;s four factors further reflect a comprehensive understanding of AI literacy, entailing not only technical and cognitive competencies, but also a visionary and ethical understanding of AI&#x2019;s role in medicine. The study critically fills a lacuna in the existing literature by providing a valid and reliable instrument, termed as the Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students (MAIRS-MS), for measuring medical AI readiness. Through this, Karaca et al. are contributing not only to assessment but also to potential curriculum development and ensuring that medical students are well-equipped to navigate the evolving landscape of medical practice. The bridging of technical understanding with ethical foresight in the study underlines the importance of being well-rounded and AI literate in the medical field, going beyond a technology-only focus.</p>
<p><a href="#ref2_23" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Laupichler et al. (2022)</a> is a scoping literature review that sought to define the constructs of AI literacy in higher and adult education and explore its implications, given the pervasive influence of AI across various sectors. The review covers several important themes of AI literacy, including its definitions, evolution, and practical applications in educational settings. It attempts to provide a structured understanding of AI literacy, drawing from a variety of research and initiatives aimed at promoting this literacy among diverse target groups, particularly non-experts. One salient point in the article is its definition of AI literacy, which is framed as the ability to comprehend, utilise, and critically evaluate AI technologies without necessarily having the aptitude to develop AI models. Through its detailed discussion of various AI literacy programmes and their design, objectives, and target demographics, the authors provide a comprehensive view of the ongoing efforts to cultivate AI literacy and underscores the importance of adapting educational strategies to meet the needs of different learner groups. For more in-depth information about AI literacy research in the higher and adult education context, we recommend reading Laupichler et al.&#x2019;s full article.</p>
<p>In their <a href="#ref2_27" id="R_ref2_27" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a> study, Markauskaite et al. challenged the notion of &#x201C;AI literacy&#x201D; and proposed the concept of &#x201C;AI capabilities&#x201D;, arguing that the latter is more comprehensive as it positions AI competencies as an extension of learners&#x2019; pre-existing skills. This perspective reflects a holistic approach and underscores three critical perspectives, cognitive, humanistic, and social, which collectively shift the emphasis from merely learning about AI to cultivating human cognitive capacities, values, and joint knowledge necessary for thriving in a world saturated with AI. This emphasis on an ecology of technology, cognition, social interaction, and values is a notable departure from narrow AI-centred narratives, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p31" aria-label=" page 31. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>advocating for more nuanced and inclusive dialogue. The methodological design of the study is also unique and collaborative, with 11 co-authors engaging in a polylogue, a semi-independent, and semi-joint written discussion to explore and articulate the capabilities essential in an AI-infused world. The discourse delves into conceptual and methodological frameworks for understanding, developing, and assessing these capabilities.</p>
<p>The study, however, isn&#x2019;t without its limitations. The exploration, although broad, seems to grapple with the challenge of pinning down a definitive set of necessary capabilities due to the diverse and sometimes unpredictable impacts of AI across different sectors and geographical locales. Furthermore, while the authors&#x2019; diverse disciplinary backgrounds help to enrich their discussions, it also highlights the variegated understanding and expectations of AI, which could potentially skew the identification and assessment of requisite capabilities. Still, the study is a significant stride towards fostering a multi-dimensional understanding of AI capabilities and promotes discourse that transcends technical literacy to include a more human-centric and societal approach. Through their dialogical knowledge-making approach, Markauskaite et al. highlight the critical need for interdisciplinary dialogues, and broader and richer conceptualisations of the capabilities essential for navigating the intricacies and potential disruptions of AI on global society.</p>
<p><a href="#ref2_7" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Cetindamar et al. (2022)</a> sought to define AI literacy in the context of organisational and digital workplaces. Based on their scoping review, AI literacy is conceptualised as a bundle of four core capabilities: technology-related, work-related, human-machine-related, and learning-related. The technology-related capabilities are foundational as AI literacy is rooted in technology, encompassing elements like data availability, technological infrastructure, and technical skills which are vital for utilising AI in various domains (e.g., one&#x2019;s ability to collect and analyse data). Work-related capabilities enable effective AI implementation in the workplace, and includes a range of competencies such as ethical considerations for AI usage, critical thinking, problem solving, and communication skills, all of which support complex cognitive and decision-making tasks. Human-machine-related capabilities focuses on enhancing and leveraging the collaboration between humans and AI, emphasising the need for geometric reasoning, situational assessment, human-aware task planning, and increasing the explainability of AI to foster genuine human&#x2013;machine interactions. Lastly, learning-related capabilities refer to the importance of continuous lifelong learning to keep up with the rapidly evolving and volatile digital landscape. This entails fostering self-learning abilities, managerial skills, problem solving, and other soft skills to ensure responsible usage of digital technologies and facilitate skills development that align with the demands of the AI-driven world.</p>
<p>Finally, in a more recent article, <a href="#ref2_20" id="R_ref2_20" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Kong et al. (2023)</a> defined AI literacy as the ability to understand the fundamental concepts of AI, its applications, and its implications for society. They designed and evaluated an AI literacy programme based on a multi-dimensional conceptual framework, which developed participants&#x2019; conceptual understanding, literacy, empowerment, and ethical awareness.</p>
<p>Collectively, these studies help enrich the understanding of AI literacy, extending dialogue beyond technical dimensions to also encompass psychological readiness, existing competencies, and the progressive evolution of AI literacy itself. Nonetheless, they expose the prevailing ambiguities and the multi-dimensional essence of this literacy, which could potentially hinder the formulation of a universally accepted framework or definition. The divergent yet complementary perspectives provided by these scholars thus underscore the richness of the discourse as well as the need for a multi-faceted approach in both research and educational practices for fostering AI literacy.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p32" aria-label=" page 32.

<p>This comprehensive framework, derived from data and literature, not only bolsters an individual&#x2019;s proficiency in handling AI technologies, but also propels collective advancement towards a digitised future where technology is an ally, not an enigma. As emphasised, for the average person, a basic level of AI literacy is essential to navigate the increasingly AI-driven world. This level of literacy does not require in-depth technical knowledge but should include a general understanding of the framework&#x2019;s five aspects, as summarised in <a href="#table2_2" id="R_table2_2">Table 2.2</a>.</p>

<p>By nurturing this foundational level of AI literacy, the average individual can make better educated and informed decisions, partake in substantial discussions regarding AI and its impacts, and be conscious of the ramifications of AI technologies on their personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, AI&#x2019;s relevance can be context-dependent. According to an article in Forbes by <a href="#ref2_30" id="R_ref2_30" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Talagala (2021)</a>, one of the Four C&#x2019;s of AI literacy is context, which stresses that the use, strengths, limitations, and suitability of AI can be extremely context-dependent. To effectively prepare the future workforce, it is therefore essential to not only explore generic AI literacy that all individuals should possess, but also any specific AI literacy requirements particular to and necessary for a person&#x2019;s role or profession (for example, for teachers). Stated differently, the AI literacy that an individual should possess encompasses both the foundational AI literacy level explained above (<a href="#table2_2">Table 2.2</a>), as well as any AI literacy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p34" aria-label=" page 34. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>requisites that are relevant to their role or profession (see <a href="#fig2_1" id="R_fig2_1">Figure 2.1</a>, the Dynamic AI Literacy Model for Specific Roles, the diagram is actual above not below).</p>
<figure id="fig2_1"><img src="images/fig2_1_B.jpg" alt="A chart indicating details of the Dynamic A I Literacy Model in the case of particular roles."/>

<section aria-labelledby="sec2_5_1">
<h3 id="sec2_5_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">2.5.1 </span>Expanding the Fundamental AI Literacy Framework: Incorporating Role-Specific and Multilevel Considerations</h3>
<p>Possessing foundational AI literacy, as discussed above, encapsulates having the vital understanding to navigate through the modern, technologically-driven world and is needed by every individual, irrespective of their professional milieu. As per the five aspects &#x2013; concepts, applications, affectiveness for human emotions, safety and security, and responsible usage &#x2013; the foundational framework does offer a broad panorama of AI awareness necessary for informed interactions and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Delving deeper, one must also acknowledge that AI literacy requires further dissection, especially to consider how different professional contexts alter what individuals need to know and do when interacting with AI. <a href="#ref2_30" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Talagala (2021)</a> emphasises this point of considering &#x2018;context,&#x2019; which becomes even more salient when thinking about how different sectors may use and be affected by AI &#x2013; for applications in healthcare for example, errors could be life-threatening, while in business, AI might be used to influence brand image and reputation.</p>
<p>The depth and specificity of knowledge required by different professionals inevitably varies. This means that a layered approach to AI literacy &#x2013; where we consider the necessary level of literacy (high, medium, or low) in each of the framework&#x2019;s five components, as required for specific professions and roles &#x2013; would enable the foundational framework to be more holistic and applicable. This expanded framework is the Dynamic AI Literacy Model (DAILM) for Specific Roles, as shown in <a href="#fig2_1">Figure 2.1</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the difference between an AI software programmer and a general practitioner in the medical field. While the former will likely need a high level of literacy across all five aspects of the foundational framework, particularly in order to programme <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p35" aria-label=" page 35. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>AI systems themselves, the latter may not need the same level or depth of mastery across the five components. A general practitioner&#x2019;s needs and interactions with AI are different &#x2013; perhaps they will focus primarily on a medium level in AI&#x2019;s applications, AI&#x2019;s affectiveness for human emotions, safety, and responsible usage. The practitioner would not need the same extent of in-depth knowledge about the creation and development of AI systems (i.e., a low level of literacy in this is adequate) to still be able to interact effectively and responsibly with the AI technologies they commonly encounter in their context.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec2_5_1_1">
<h4 id="sec2_5_1_1"><span epub:type="ordinal">2.5.1.1 </span>A Case Study: AI Literacy Amongst Different Professionals</h4>
<p>To elucidate the above, an AI software programmer would not only need to understand what AI systems are, but also actively innovate, develop, and review new AI systems and programmes. They would need a distinctly high level of literacy across the five aspects of the foundational framework, so that they can deep-dive into advanced concepts and applications, including algorithmic biases and data privacy laws. Their need to carefully make ethical considerations in system design and deployment further elevates their need for high literacy in recognising responsible AI usage and safety and security issues. In addition, programmers can develop AI systems that can understand and respond to human emotions. This can lead to more personalised and engaging user experiences, as the AI can adapt its behavior and responses based on the user&#x2019;s emotions, leading to improved user satisfaction and engagement.</p>
<p>Conversely, a medical general practitioner may primarily interact with AI through its integration into diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient data management. Therefore, while a medium to high literacy level in AI applications, affectiveness, safety, and data security would be needed to ensure accurate and ethical patient care, an in-depth understanding of AI concepts may not be as critical, thus only requiring a low to medium level of literacy in this aspect for this specific role.</p>
<p>The contrast between these two roles highlights a key consideration: the need for an additional factor in the foundational AI Literacy Framework, where specific aspects are highlighted and others de-emphasised, based on the professional context. Any new context or role-specific aspects can also be integrated as necessary, allowing flexibility for industries to each define AI literacy as per their standards of practice. Hence, developing a multi-faceted, level-based AI literacy framework, which incorporates the five core aspects and introduces role-specific additions or expansions, would significantly enhance the applicability and value of AI literacy across different professional fields.</p>
<p>In sum, while the foundational AI Literacy Framework lays a robust groundwork for general understanding and engagement with AI technologies, a multi-dimensional, context-specific, and level-based extension of its five aspects is imperative to truly cater to the varied, nuanced needs of different professionals in their respective fields. The proposed enhanced framework, the DAILM for Specific Roles, not only aligns with the multi-dimensionality of real-world AI applications, but also fortifies AI users&#x2019; capacity to interact, innovate, and ethically engage with these technologies in a manner that is pragmatically embedded in their specific professional context.</p></section></section>

<h2 id="sec2_6"><span epub:type="ordinal">2.6 </span>Advantages and Disadvantages of Developing AI Literacy</h2>
<p>Building upon the foundational understanding of AI literacy explored in the preceding sections, it is imperative to next examine the advantages of nurturing this competence in our progressively digital world. We will now turn to the specific benefits of equipping individuals and society at large with this literacy, the discussions of which can also support teachers and policymakers in making informed decisions about resources and policy. The subsequent sections will unpack these various advantages, providing a comprehensive overview that further substantiates the integral role of AI literacy in contemporary and future contexts.</p>
<p class="list-title"><b>Advantages of Developing AI Literacy</b></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p><b>Informed Decision-Making:</b></p>
<p>Developing AI literacy enhances an individual&#x2019;s ability to make informed decisions. Understanding how AI systems work will allow the individual to also make sense of and appraise any recommendations, predictions, and decisions made by these systems. This is crucial across various sectors as well as in daily life, where algorithms shape how content and information are disseminated and presented.</p></li>
<li>
<p><b>Ethical Use and Development:</b></p>
<p>With AI literacy also comes the ability to recognise and address the ethical implications of AI technologies. This includes understanding and mitigating issues related to bias in data and information, privacy, and taking accountability as users.

<li>
<p><b>Digital Citizenship:</b></p>
<p>In an age where numerous aspects of life and governance are shifting onto online platforms, AI literacy fosters responsible and informed digital citizenship. Understanding AI helps individuals to interact wisely and ethically with digital platforms, recognise misinformation, and engage productively in online environments.</p></li></ol>
<p>As we journey through the vast and still much-uncharted world of AI, it is clear that getting to grips with AI literacy is not just helpful, but crucial, particularly for the upcoming generations. As our world becomes increasingly digitalised, learning about AI is now a must in our daily, educational, and professional lives. AI is more than a tool &#x2013; it is a force that changes the way we interact, create, and think.</p>
<p>However, developing AI literacy across the board does come with its own set of challenges that need careful thought and strategic planning. One major hurdle is how resource-intensive AI education can be. Making sure educational programmes are both in-depth enough and accessible will require a lot of time, money, and expertise, putting a strain on resources especially in areas or institutions that may not have a lot to spare (<a href="#ref2_32" id="R_ref2_32" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">West, 2018</a>). Additionally, there is a risk of becoming overly dependent on AI, which may consequently result in the subtle and valuable aspects of human decision-making being overlooked or ignored (<a href="#ref2_2" id="R_ref2_2" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Bostrom, 2014</a>; <a href="#ref2_11" id="R_ref2_11" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Chan &#x0026; Hu, 2023</a>). An example of this is if an individual over-relies on GPS for navigation and ignores developing their natural sense of direction and spatial awareness; another is if in education, a student relies too much on GenAI tools to summarise and write, eventually losing their fundamental ability and skills to do so themselves.</p>
<p>At a further layer, differences in socio-economic status also stand as a considerable obstacle for achieving universal AI literacy. There is a real risk of increasing the &#x201C;digital divide&#x201D;, where those with fewer resources and greater difficultly in accessing technology get <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p40" aria-label=" page 40. " role="doc-pagebreak"/>left behind, unable to fully engage with or benefit from our digital world (<a href="#ref2_13" id="R_ref2_13" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Eubanks, 2018</a>). Furthermore, because AI is always evolving, it requires a culture of constant learning and adaptation. While instilling such a culture is essentially a good thing, it can also bring pressures and challenges, such as in keeping up with the continual influx of technological advancements (<a href="#ref2_12" id="R_ref2_12" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Crawford &#x0026; Calo, 2016</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, potential misconduct and security vulnerabilities are also looming concerns. It is possible that self-serving individuals may use their mastery of AI literacy to manipulate or exploit AI systems, introducing a whole range of ethical and practical challenges (<a href="#ref2_37" id="R_ref2_37" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref">Zuboff, 2019</a>). For example, hackers may manipulate AI algorithms or data to their advantage; there may also be risks of identity theft or scams carried out through the use of advanced deep-fake AI technologies.</p>
<p>Thus, as we work towards establishing universal AI literacy, combining its benefits and navigating through the challenges, it is key to ensure that we do so in ways that are balanced, inclusive, and critically reflective. Incorporating AI literacy as an essential part of our future will demand a united, thoughtful, and ethical approach to ensure AI&#x2019;s benefits can be accessed by all and that its challenges are carefully and effectively managed.</p></section>

<p>AI literacy, as we have explored throughout this chapter, isn&#x2019;t just a technical skill &#x2013; it is vital for us to navigate effectively through our increasingly AI-driven world, and especially in higher education. From making informed decisions to understanding the ripple effects of technology in our lives and societies, becoming AI-literate shapes our approach to ethical, strategic, and innovative thinking. The journey through the different domains of AI literacy is not simply about just understanding mechanics; it further involves guiding the ethical and inclusive development and application of AI itself, in our daily lives and educational systems. The Foundational AI Literacy Framework serves as vital guide in this journey, offering structure in navigating the complexities of AI and emphasising the essential components of understanding AI concepts, its applications, affectiveness for human emotions, safety, and responsible usage. Meanwhile, the Dynamic AI Literacy Model (DAILM) takes it a step further by integrating a role-specific approach, recognising the multi-faceted interactions and ethical considerations across various professional fields. Together, these frameworks not only fortify general and professional AI literacy, but also ensure that individuals and professionals interact with AI technologies in a manner that is informed, ethical, and deeply embedded in their specific contexts. The synthesis of foundational knowledge and role-specific literacy via the DAILM shapes a future where technology is not an enigma but an ally, safeguarding ethical, innovative, and responsible progression in the AI-driven era.</p>

<h3 id="box2_1">Questions to Ponder</h3>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Considering the rapid evolution of AI technologies and applications, how can the AI Literacy Framework and DAILM remain relevant and adapt to emerging trends, tools, and ethical considerations?</li>
<li>How can the DAILM be extended to cater to specific professional roles that may emerge in the future, ensuring that it is not only applicable to current professions but also adaptable to future developments in the job market?</li>
<li>How might the AI Literacy Framework and DAILM be adapted or modified to address cultural, legal, and socio-economic variations in AI literacy and application needs across different global contexts?</li>
<li>How might the AI Literacy Framework be integrated into educational curricula at various levels (from primary to tertiary education) to foster a future workforce that is adept and ethical when navigating AI technologies?</li>
<li>How can the effectiveness and impact of the AI Literacy Framework and DAILM be assessed and measured across diverse populations and professional fields?</li></ul></aside>

<h3 id="box2_2">Personal Reflection</h3>
<p>Imagine the future where your level of AI literacy guides your choices and opportunities. How would our understanding (or misunderstanding) of AI technology shape our decisions and social interactions? As we look towards a future where new generations will have AI naturally integrated into their lives, how will they navigate a world filled with such technological wonders as well as new ethical, social, and maybe even political challenges? Will we have to constantly update our literacy in AI in order to continue having a place and role in society, and not become replaced? Is it the case that the more we invent, the more we have to sacrifice?</p></aside></section>
