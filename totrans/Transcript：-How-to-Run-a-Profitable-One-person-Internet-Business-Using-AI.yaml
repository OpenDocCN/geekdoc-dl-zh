- en: So Glassdoor is basically an anonymous site for people to leave a review on
    your employer.So I was like, okay, well, where did that all come from? How did
    that start? How did they start getting people to write reviews on a site like
    that? How did Glassdoor get reviews on the site initially? Did they run any incentives?
    I was looking at that kind of thing. So, things like that. It’s just an interesting
    way to start exploring an idea and where it’s gonna go and how it changes over
    time.
