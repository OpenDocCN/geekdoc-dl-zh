    eyes. You might think she has an uncanny knack for spotting trends online, but
    I discover that there‚Äôs a method to her approach. Steph also reveals the internet‚Äôs
    most underrated advantage: validating business ideas cheaply and quickly. Figuring
    out if an idea is worth it before going all-in is a huge unlock for creative minds
    everywhere. As we talk, I pitch Steph two businesses, and we use an arsenal of
    tools and strategies to vet them live on the show.'

    ideas around stuff she‚Äôs thinking about‚Äîshe recently used an icebreaker it suggested
    at a meetup she was hosting. ‚Äú[C]hatGPT is really good at helping me extrapolate
    from a base,‚Äù Steph says.'

    new ideas and ‚Äúfill‚Äù[s] them in with details by pulling information from different
    places to answer her queries. ‚Äú[C]hatGPT questions are the ones where you''re
    like, ‚ÄòI actually don''t think this exists explicitly like this on Google,‚Äô‚Äù she
    says.'

    but also understands, information via ChatGPT. ‚Äú[T]his program can take something
    very complex and usher it back down and also the other way ‚Äôround,‚Äù she says‚Äîlike
    explaining dark matter in the voice of Spongebob.'

    her the ‚Äúother side‚Äù of a debate‚Äîespecially when ‚ÄúI have a strong opinion here,
    but I also have a feeling I don''t know enough about this subject,‚Äù she explains.'

    useful formats: She got GPT-4 to categorize and format a long list of words for
    her [database of untranslatable words](https://eunoia.world/). Steph had to correct
    a few mistakes, but she explains that ‚Äúinstead of me doing it myself for six hours‚Ä¶I
    could get 90 percent plus there in 15 minutes. That‚Äôs much better.‚Äù'

    a business idea I hold close to my heart (or, more accurately, my head)‚Äîmaking
    warm baseball caps.

- en: '**Use Google to gauge demand.** Steph‚Äôs first move is Googling the product
    and using an SEO tool to find metrics like the number of searches per month. Baked
    into Google searches are people‚Äôs ‚Äúwants, needs, desires,‚Äù she explains, so while
    the raw search volume doesn‚Äôt determine if an idea is good or bad, it does help
    to get a sense of market size.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Analyze customer reviews.** Another tactic Steph uses to gauge demand is
    scouring customer reviews of comparable products. She thinks two- and three-star
    reviews are ‚Äúlittle pockets‚Äù of insight because they represent relatively balanced,
    practical opinions.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    secondary keyword analysis, to check if people are searching for ‚Äúsynonym permutations‚Äù
    of warm baseball caps. Unfortunately, we come up empty.‚Äú[A]nytime Google is trying
    to take you in a different direction‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a pretty strong indicator,‚Äù she says.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Use SEO tools!** Steph is an advocate of plugins that surface insights as
    you browse. ‚Äú[[Keywords Everywhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com/)] is great
    because it allows you to spot things passively, which‚Ä¶is one of the most underrated
    things that you can do on your internet journey,‚Äù she says.'

    for a Thai noodle dish that I love called [khao soi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khao_soi).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Break down Google‚Äôs search results.** When Steph Googles khao soi, she points
    out that most of the results are recipe pages. ‚ÄúGoogle tells you the intent of
    people searching it just by nature of what is on the page,‚Äù she says.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Research related products.** Steph recommends contextualizing absolute search
    volume numbers by looking up related products. ‚ÄúThere''s no straight answer as
    to whether 110,000 [the number of search results per month for khao soi] is good,
    but we can also look at something that''s a little more popular and common, something
    like pad thai or green curry to see,‚Äù she says.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Spot the trend.** Steph‚Äôs next move is understanding whether the search is
    trending up or down on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) (spoiler
    alert: We find that khao soi is trending up). ‚ÄúI love to see charts like this,
    by the way, which are like low volume, but like growing for sure,‚Äù Steph says.'

    that serve khao soi and notices that most of them are not rated well. ‚ÄúSome people
    might be thinking, ‚ÄòOh well, not all of this is extremely data-driven,‚Äô but I
    think what''s helpful along the research journey is just picking up on things,‚Äù
    she says.'

    is Reddit, with a [tool](https://anvaka.github.io/sayit/?query=) that visualizes
    ‚Äúinterconnections on Reddit in any given subreddit.‚Äù Steph points out that Asian
    food subreddits indicate that popular dishes like ramen have ‚Äúsuper fans who really
    take offense to when it''s done badly.‚Äù'

    to get data on top posts, emerging themes, and common keywords.'

- en: '**Competitor analysis.** To refine our idea-validation process, Steph suggests
    looking up potential competitors. To kickstart this she searches for khao soi
    recipe kits and feeds the resulting websites ‚Äúinto a tool like [similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/)
    to see the volume, the number of page views they have a month‚Äù she says.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Decode what success looks like in the market.** Steph goes deeper on competitor
    web pages through [similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/) to understand the
    market better. She notices that they don‚Äôt do any paid search, which sparks questions
    like, ‚ÄúWhat if I actually juiced my product with paid‚Äîcould I outcompete them?‚Äù'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It looks like khao soi might just be a better business than warm baseball caps.
    However, the internet won‚Äôt tell you which business you should start. According
    to Steph, going down internet rabbit holes to validate ideas often comes down
    to a personal decision. ‚ÄúPeople just need to decide, from these data points, is
    this the kind of business I want to build?‚Äù she says.
