    first answer is that there are folks who are working on formal theories of mental
    health or mental disorders. They don''t take everything into account and they
    probably will never be like Newton''s theory of gravitation—which also ended up
    to be false, by the way. So maybe that''s also okay in a way. In addition I think
    our models or theories are probably going to be useful idealizations. I like to
    use the map of Rome or the tube map of London as an example, where the map is
    useful for the purpose that you designed [it] to be, such as navigating the Metro
    system in London or finding your next Starbucks in Rome. So a good model is one
    that sort of leaves out unimportant stuff. But, of course, then the question is,
    what is unimportant to leave out? But the main point is that there is work happening
    right now on formal theorizing. We have a paper on panic disorder led by [Don
    Robinaugh](https://robinaugh.weebly.com/), for example, which is basically a system
    of eight or nine nodes or bio-psychosocial variables that have been shown to be
    really relevant to panic disorder.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**EF:** 对，我有两个答案。它们是完全不同的答案。第一个答案是，有一些人正在研究精神健康或精神障碍的正式理论。他们并不考虑一切，而且它们可能永远不会像牛顿的万有引力理论那样——顺便说一句，它最终也被证明是错误的。所以也许从某种意义上来说这也没问题。此外，我认为我们的模型或理论可能会是有用的理想化。我喜欢用罗马地图或伦敦地铁图作为例子，地图对于你设计它的目的来说是有用的，比如在伦敦地铁系统中导航或在罗马找到你的下一个星巴克。所以一个好的模型是那种剔除了不重要的东西的模型。但是，当然，问题是，什么是不重要的需要剔除的？但主要观点是，目前正在进行着关于正式理论化的工作。我们有一篇由[唐·罗宾诺](https://robinaugh.weebly.com/)领导的有关恐慌症的论文，该论文基本上是一个由八九个节点或生物—心理—社会变量组成的系统，这些变量已被证明与恐慌症密切相关。'
- en: We worked on panic disorder first because if you draw 50 random researchers
    on panic disorder from around the world to the table, most of them will actually
    agree on the etiology and phenomenology of panic disorder, which is not the case
    for some other mental problems. So we started there, and the model is basically
    a formal theory, a formal model, and their equations. And then you can simulate
    data from the model. And then you can see if the data you get for a person with
    panic attacks, for example, corresponds to data we observe in the real world.
    You can see, [what] does the phenomenology of panic attacks look like? OK, they're
    brief, check that they should be pretty brief. Panic attacks don't last for half
    an hour or three hours.

  zh: 我们首先研究了恐慌症，因为如果你把全球50位随机的恐慌症研究者召集到一起，他们中大多数实际上会就恐慌症的病因学和表现学达成一致，而这对于一些其他精神问题并非如此。因此，我们从那里开始，该模型基本上是一个正式的理论、一个正式的模型以及它们的方程式。然后你可以从模型中模拟数据。然后你可以看看你为患有恐慌发作的人得到的数据是否与我们在现实世界中观察到的数据相对应。你可以看看，恐慌发作的表现学是什么样子的？好的，他们是短暂的，检查一下，他们应该相当短暂。恐慌发作不会持续半个小时或三个小时。
- en: Can you simulate interventions using behavioral therapy on the system, and panic
    attacks become less? Yeah, you can actually do that. But we also find, for example,
    that there are people who have panic attacks without developing panic disorder.
    And in our model, everybody who gets panic attacks gets panic disorder. So [we’re]
    showing you that there's also limits to these theories, and it's a very initial
    model. But in principle, there's work on theorizing using differential equations.

    argues that it actually doesn't matter too much what particular nodes you assess
    in your system, as long as all of these nodes tap into the dynamics of the system,
    because it is measuring the dynamics that give you information about the system

    times a day about their moods, feelings, thoughts, behaviors, and ecological momentary
    assessment. They track them for multiple weeks. And the cool thing is that every
    person gets different variables assessed. Everybody's different. They all agree
    with their own clinician on what is most central to their psychopathology, even
    if the diagnosis is the same. Some folks sleep too little, some sleep too much,
    even if they have the same diagnosis. Some people are sad, others are suicidal
    and so forth. The analysis in the paper shows that you can, independent of the
    content of the network or the system, use these dynamical principles to see if
    people are going to get better or not.

    [It] doesn''t always have to be smartphone data. It doesn''t have to be self-reported.
    It can also be somewhat more objective digital phenotyping data. And then you
    can, in a system, model the relationships between these things. I can see that
    whenever I sleep really well, I''m relaxed the next morning. Whenever I''m outside
    or exercise, I''m less active at the next measurement moment. Things like this.
    You can model contiguous relationships at the moment, but also temporal relationships

- en: The way critical slowing down works, without being super-technical about it,
    is that when a system transitions from one stable state into another stable state,
    and when this transition is abrupt, this is important. We'll talk about this later,
    perhaps because there's also slow transitions, and it doesn't really work that
    well then. But if the transition is abrupt, like a catastrophic shift, then there's
    evidence in ecology and cancer biology and economics and other climate science,
    that the elements of the system change their autocorrelations over time. The system
    becomes more predictable, and the system moves slower, so to speak.

  zh: 临界减速的工作原理，不需要对此进行太技术性的解释，就是当一个系统从一个稳定状态转变成另一个稳定状态时，而且这个转变是突然的，这就很重要。我们可能会稍后讨论这一点，也许因为也有缓慢的过渡，那时就不会很有效。但如果过渡是突然的，像一个灾难性的转变，那么在生态学、癌症生物学、经济学和其他气候科学中都有证据表明，系统的元素随时间改变了自相关性。系统变得更可预测，系统变得运动更慢，可以这么说。
- en: That's why you say critical slowing down. So translating this to my mental health
    example, if I know your current mood or sleepiness or concentration or suicidal
    state right now, and I see that your state tomorrow will become more and more
    predictable from your current state, we're talking about critical slowing down,
    which is an early warning sign for an upcoming transition. This has been shown
    a couple of times in data with depression, for example, in usually just one particular
    person. There's other dynamic principles, connectivity, and so forth. But this
    early warning, critical slowing down, is one of the ones that has been discussed
    the most. If you think of a system like a river, and you can measure the speed
    of the river using different types of thermometers, this ideographic argument
    where the content doesn't really matter, the dynamic principles matter. [That]
    translates into, well, as long as you put your thermometer somewhere in the river,
    and you pick up some part of the system, that will give you enough information
    to pick up on changes, and for example, autocorrelations to tap into critical
    slowing down. If that works or not, we don't know.

  zh: 这就是为什么你会说临界减速。所以用我的心理健康例子来解释的话，如果我知道你现在的心情、睡意、注意力或者自杀状态，而我看到明天你的状态将会越来越能从你现在的状态进行预测，我们就在谈论临界减速，这是即将发生转变的一个早期预警信号。比如在抑郁症的数据中已经有几次出现，虽然通常只是在一个特定的人身上。还有其他动态原则、连接性等方面。但这种早期预警，临界减速，是被讨论得最多的。如果你把一个系统想象成一个河流，并且你可以使用不同类型的温度计来测量河流的速度，这种思想法则真的很重要，因为内容并不真的重要，动态原则才是重要的。这就成了，只要你把你的温度计放在河流的某个地方，并且你能找到系统的某一部分，这就能够给你足够的信息来发现变化，比如自相关来发现临界减速。这是否有效，我们不知道。

- en: theory and what the difference is. My take now is that one of the biggest challenges
    is to try to bring your data to bear on your theory. When I explain this to students,
    I always use linear regression. I learned as a student that linear regression
    has an assumption, namely that variables need to be related linearly. But I never
    really got my head around truly what it means that a model has an assumption.
    How I think about this now is that if your theory predicts a linear relationship,
    then you should use a model that imposes a linear relationship on your data that
    you can then try to bring the data to bear on the theory. That's sort of the circle,
    but we don't have theories to impose assumptions on data to then bring them to
    bear on our theory so that people just use statistical models. We use linear regression.
    There's no justification for it. That's not easy, but I think it's indeed a challenge
    that we use models. And in my paper, I talk about a couple of areas of psychology,
    like factor models, for example, that everybody uses, but I rarely see the rationale
    for why these models are the right models to bring the data to bear on your theory.
    And if that step isn't taken, things get tricky very quickly.

  zh: 理论以及它们之间的区别。我现在的看法是，最大的挑战之一是试图将你的数据与你的理论联系起来。当我向学生解释这一点时，我总是用线性回归来举例。作为一个学生，我学到线性回归有一个假设，即变量需要线性相关。但我从未真正理解过一个模型有一个假设意味着什么。现在我是这样想的，如果你的理论预测了一个线性关系，那么你应该使用一个将线性关系强加给你的数据的模型，然后尝试将数据与理论联系起来。这是一个循环，但我们没有理论来对数据做出假设，然后将它们应用于我们的理论，所以人们只是使用统计模型。我们使用线性回归。这并不容易，但我认为使用模型的确是一个挑战。在我的论文中，我谈到了心理学的一些领域，比如因素模型，例如，每个人都在使用，但我很少看到为什么这些模型是正确的模型来将数据应用于你的理论的理由。如果没有这一步，事情很快就会变得棘手起来。

    doesn't conform at all to any measurement practices 60 years later. That's not

    things that are part of this measurement instrument are quite irrelevant to what
    we think depression is today. And yet we still use it. And so the epistemic iteration
    hasn't really happened. We have learned a lot about the theory of depression,
    but our measures haven't improved. And this is relevant for the black box stuff,
    because I would raise the question, but what should we measure? You would say,
    “Everything,” but I'm like, I don't think that's how it works. So I think the
