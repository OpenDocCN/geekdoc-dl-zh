    He hates them so much that he spends a lot of his time building AI bots that eliminate
    them from his life as much as possible.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nakajima is a GP at a small venture firm, Untapped Capital, so he has a GPT-3
    bot that answers common questions from founders. It emails responses to them and
    includes a way for him to refine them over time—so it continually improves.
  prefs: []

    has. He reviews these before meetings so that he’s always up to date on founders
    and LPs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He has another one that, given a startup’s website, can draft an investment
    memo that includes data like the company’s value proposition, a description of
    its product, its likely competitors, and even the sentiment from its Product Hunt
    launch.
  prefs: []

    emails from his kids’ schools—so he never has to spend time looking up deadlines
    or important events again.

    I argued that “rather than replacing individuals, recent advances in AI will *empower*
    them to make an impact on a scale matching some of the biggest businesses, research
    labs, and creative organizations of today.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tools that Yohei is building for himself are a prime early example of this
    dynamic in action. He told me that, as a venture capitalist, “Time is the number
    one blocker. If you can unlock time, you’re instantly better at your job.” That’s
    exactly what AI is enabling him to do. What might not have been possible for a
    small VC firm a few years ago might be eminently possible in a year or two if
    these tools continue to develop.

    work and polish to function perfectly. But they’re already allowing him to spend

    good at: sourcing deals and deciding on investments.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve been working in startups my whole career. Initially, I tried to start my
    own right out of college. I made every mistake possible, but it helped me get
    connected with the LA startup scene. From there I worked for TechStars, where
    I helped to spin up their Disney accelerator, and eventually became their Director
    of Pipeline, where I was sourcing startups for about 30 accelerator programs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During that time I realized I wanted to run my own fund. So I went to [Scrum
    Ventures](https://scrum.vc/) to learn the ropes of what it’s like to be in a venture
    firm. Eventually, I decided to start my own pre-seed fund called Untapped Capital.
    It’s a $10 million fund that I run with my co-GP, [Jessica Jackley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicajackley/). 
    That was a few years ago, and that’s what I’m doing full-time now.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve always been one of those people where I don’t like to do a task over and
    over again. If I’m doing something more than once, I want it to be automated.
    So I build little tools to help me in my day-to-day work as a VC. A lot of it
    is moving stuff away from my inbox. It’s either automating it fully or putting
    it on my to-do list.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the tools I just use personally, and some of them I make available to
    the founders I invest in. They allow me to do more. I can do more work, answer
    more questions, make more intros, help more founders. The quality of the work
    the model does on its own is not going to be as high as if I’m doing it, but I
    can also help a lot more people at once.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the first projects I built when I was getting into GPT-3 is what I call
    Mini Yohei. It’s a little wrapper around GPT-3 that asks questions that founders
    might usually ask a VC.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Answering those questions is something I do all the time, right? Founders ask
    me small questions and sometimes I have the answer. But sometimes I have to Google
    around and do research myself to get an answer—I don’t know or remember everything
    off the top of my head.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A founder can ask a question like, “Where do you think power will ultimately
    reside in the AI value chain?” It will email the founder an answer and cc me,
    too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once Mini Yohei responds to a question, I’ll follow up with my own answer, and
    the founder and I can talk about it. I end up responding faster to their original
    question because I have something to respond to. If it says something that’s a
    little bit off, I can just write a correction rather than having to write an entire
    answer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't think you should ever, at this point especially, just believe AI flat
    out. That’s why I’m always cc’d on these. But, realistically, a lot of VC suggestions
    are generic. A lot of VCs are just reading up on how startups have worked in the
    past or talking about it with other VCs and founders. We're basically synthesizing
    that and applying it to whatever question the founder is asking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of that kind of thinking has been documented as blog posts. So an AI that's
    been trained on that corpus of text is going to be able to answer the most common
    questions that founders have. A more recent upgrade I made is Mini Yohei 2.0,
    which searches through VC blogs and provides answers grounded in those blog posts
    with citations. And this model gets better every time I use it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the backend, I actually have it generate three different answers because
    I'm trying to fine-tune modes to figure out what works. Some of the models are
    just prompt engineering to try to get things right. And some of them are trained
    on a Q&A that I’ve built out and uploaded.

    emails to remember what we talked about. It’s a pain to do that, so I built a
    tool that solves it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For every person I email with, it uses GPT-3 to generate a summary of all of
    our interactions. So I can just go look at one place in an Airtable and see all
    of the conversations I’ve had with someone summarized together.

    that you might have made. This helps me do that a lot faster.

    I built it. I have an interface where if I’m looking at a new company, I can generate
    a memo and share it with the founder. I can say, “Hey, I had our AI tool build
    a little memo for you. Here’re some things I found that were interesting.”
  prefs: []

    add some value for them.
  prefs: []

    investment memos in a day and shared it with my founders. All of them were like,
    “This is incredible!” And it doesn’t require me a lot of time to do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can imagine these memos getting updated over time as the companies mature
    and we get new information, through investor updates or fundraises. So I don’t
    see this as a one-and-done tool, but as something that runs continuously to create
    a living record of companies as they go through their lifecycle.

    get a response that’s generated from what’s inside of it.

    all of the emails from my kids’ schools. So I have a private dashboard that gives
    me a list with a bullet-pointed summary of every email they send me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    next X event?” or “When do I have to sign them up for Y?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normally I’d have to search through my email and read through a bunch of things
    to find the answer. But with this I can just search for keywords and it will show
    me the bullet points of what I need to know. It’s really useful for busy parents.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: VC is slow to change. The feedback loop is slow. But these tools are very useful.
    For example, having an automated summary of every interaction you have with every
    founder and every LP—every VC wants that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think automated investment memos and research that collects and synthesizes
    lots of information the second you’re interested in a company will be standard.
    There’s so much information that you can gather at the snap of a finger, and I
    think all of that will be table stakes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might also start to help with investment decisions, but I think where I sit
    at pre-seed, gut instinct and pattern recognition are still helpful. For me, it’s
    about using it to feed my gut instinct with the right information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At pre-seed, my job is to source, decide, and support. A lot of these tools
    are just moving stuff away from my email inbox, because it lets me spend more
    time on those three things.
