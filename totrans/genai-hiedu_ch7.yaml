    providing an overview of its history and details of the technology. We have presented
    the need for AI literacy and how GenAI can influence curriculum design, assessment,
    and educational policy. We have provided frameworks for defining and guiding changes
    in these areas with the goal of ensuring that desired outcomes are best achieved.
    We have also provided insight into why GenAI has reached a point where it will
    have a transformative impact on education, as well as how educational institutions
    and policymakers should respond.

    we look at the future for educational institutions and how the broader picture
    will influence the adoption of this technology in education.

    the time that we eat to the clothes we wear, or to the use of our mobile phones.
    A society cannot function successfully for long without such social norms influencing
    individual behaviour, and in turn facilitating cohesion and order ([Rachlinski,
    2000](#ref7_20)). By examining the adoption of previous innovations in society,
    we may be able to uncover a model for how AI and GenAI adoption could be similarly
    influenced by, or even reshape, our social norms.

    1990s, it was initially a small, yet sizeable group of people who were the early
    users (yes, the nerds!). It was not until much later that such adoption increased.
    One could argue that PCs were initially not hugely useful to the average person
    until after the Internet reached a point where it catered to a sufficiently broad
    set of interests. In the early days of the PC, playing computer games and writing
    simple software were not yet of interest to the majority; moreover, the widespread
    need for tools like spreadsheets and word processors only arose when they reached
    a relatively high level of regular use among the general population. This was
    assisted, or perhaps driven, by the need for these tools and related skills in
    the work environment. Eventually, they also became a necessity in the educational
    system. How many people submitted handwritten reports in the 1990s for their degree
    courses, compared to the current number of people submitting reports in this format?

    ([Statista PCs, 2019](#ref7_22)); this may not seem like a very large percentage,
    but it was possibly impacted by the introduction of smartphones. According to
    Statista, in 2020, 78% of the world’s population owned a smartphone; in 2016,
    it was less than half ([Statista Mobiles, 2019](#ref7_21)). Here, we see a much
    more rapid and broader adoption of smartphones by people across the socio-economic
    landscape. The rise of smartphones has been, in part, due to their usefulness,
    personal nature, handheld-sized convenience akin to having a PC in your pocket,
    and the huge variety of options available in terms of cost and style.

    like spreadsheets to appeal to businesses, and fast Internet connections to appeal
    to the wider public, GenAI stands out for its immediate readiness for use without
    the necessity for additional tools or technologies. However, despite its broad
    array of capabilities, **we predict** that GenAI won’t resonate with as wide a
    proportion of society as mobile phones and smartphone technology have. **We predict**
    that the primary users of AI will be the more educated members of society, regardless
    of their economic backgrounds, with a significant proportion being younger individuals.
    Still, **we predict** GenAI will be rapidly adopted by society, spanning most
    social and economic groups, and also expect that a wide variety of useful GenAI
    tools will be available and accessible (e.g., at zero or low cost options). **We
    predict** that there will be a high diversity of GenAI offerings, including chatbots,
    personal assistants, and a seamless integration of GenAI into word processing
    and text editors similar to how spell or grammar checkers are now integrated into
    these tools. With this broad range of applications, **we also predict** that it
    will be challenging to accurately measure the usage, availability, and penetration
    of GenAI.

    the job market, as illustrated by a report from Goldman Sachs ([Briggs & Kodnani,
    2023a](#ref7_3)). This has been highlighted in numerous news headlines, with Forbes
    stating that “Goldman Sachs predicts 300 million jobs will be lost or degraded
    by artificial intelligence” ([Kelly, 2023](#ref7_12)). Conversely, another headline
    for an article about the same Goldman Sachs report read, “Generative AI could
    raise global GDP by 7%” ([Briggs & Kodnani, 2023b](#ref7_4)). This exemplifies
    how news media can spin the same information to create either positive or negative
    impressions among their audiences. **We predict** that significant ‘drama’ will
    unfold regarding the impact of AI, particularly on jobs and the job market.

    impacts more intensely. For instance, Stack Overflow – a site dedicated to supporting
    software development professionals – announced a layoff of up to 28% of their
    staff in the latter half of 2023 ([Davis, 2023](#ref7_9)). Concurrently, they
    unveiled their own AI offering ([Chandrasekar, 2023](#ref7_6)) and a plan to charge
    AI companies for data usage ([Dave, 2023](#ref7_8)). While the layoffs may appear
    sudden and extreme, it is worth noting that Stack Overflow had conducted a significant
    hiring round about 12 months prior; at that time, many other tech companies were
    reducing staff numbers due to the general economic climate. Thus, not all these
    staff losses can be directly attributed to GenAI.

    in numerous sectors across the US and Europe, affecting 46% of work in the Office
    and Administrative Support sector, 44% of Legal, 37% of Architecture and Engineering,
    and 36% of the Life, Physical, and Social Science areas ([Briggs & Kodnani, 2023a](#ref7_3)).
    The report also emphasised that AI technologies still require human intervention
    and guidance, indicating that not all roles within these sectors would be affected
    equally. It pointed out that work capable of being automated by AI would be more
    prevalent in developed markets than in emerging ones, with Japan, Israel, and
    Hong Kong being the most highly impacted. The report further underscored that
    any new jobs created would constitute the bulk of employment growth during such
    a transition into greater automation of tasks. For instance, of the current US
    employment rate, only 40% are in occupations that have existed since 1940, while
    60% are in occupations that emerged thereafter.

    individuals to perform their jobs more efficiently. GenAI still requires human
    intervention for direction, purpose, and to drive it towards useful, helpful,
    and productive outcomes. This can be taken to mean that the rise of GenAI will
    not necessarily jeopardise anyone’s jobs – only the individual working that job,
    who will need to keep up to date with the necessary skills and knowledge to best
    leverage GenAI for their work – and that, overall, it will likely be perceived
    to have a positive impact. It could mean that companies, whose employees have
    already begun to use GenAI to assist with their responsibilities, will not need
    to hire extra people for a new project as the existing team – with the help of
    GenAI – can manage the additional workload.
  prefs: []

- en: As such, **our prediction** is that any negative impacts on employment will
    neither slow nor significantly affect GenAI adoption. **We also predict** that
    GenAI will impact roles in the knowledge-based economy more than, say, manual
    labour-based roles, and that those in these knowledge-based jobs are more likely
    to be the early users of GenAI. This results in the impacted workforce being in
    a better position, due to their relatively high level of education, to adapt to
    the new reality more than ever before. These changes will be hard to measure,
    and the impact on key job numbers will not be obvious, similar to the case of
    the ‘The Great Attrition’ during the pandemic in the US ([Ellingrud et al., 2023](#ref7_10)).
    **We predict** that, ultimately, there will be an increase in the number of people
    employed in the knowledge economy due to the additional roles, companies, and
    needs that currently do not even exist, growing vastly more than the consolidation
    that will happen on existing roles due to efficiencies allowed by AI. **We also
    predict** that the knowledge economy of the future will involve a much stronger
    mix of holistic competencies together with knowledge skills than previously.

    to legal services firms. Their adoption of this technology is happening rapidly,
    especially in smaller organisations. Larger organisations, on the other hand,
    are proceeding more cautiously due to concerns surrounding commercial privacy,
    trust, and risk. They need to understand the legal risks and potential liabilities
    given the novelty of this technology and the areas of law that it may touch. For
    example, could they, through their use of GenAI models, potentially have liabilities
    due to copyright issues arising from how the model is trained by its developers
    (e.g., the copyright issue of using Harry Potter works by OpenAI in their products;
    [Usman, 2023](#ref7_25))? Still, despite the slower pace of integration among
    larger organisations, it seems that their full embracing of GenAI will just be
    a matter of time. This could be expedited if AI product companies address enterprise
    concerns with specific offerings that cater to their risk appetite, or if these
    enterprises become more comfortable with the risks involved, drawing from their
    previous experiences with technologies like cloud computing or outsourcing services.

    will continue, with the use of AI and GenAI becoming an expected skill and capability
    for a broad variety of roles within organisations. It may even become a fundamental
    and widely required competence, akin to how essential basic computer skills are
    nowadays, and eventually become a set of skills that people are presumed to have
    by the time they enter the workplace. Until that point, it is likely that job
    descriptions will continue to specify the experience and proficiency expected
    for specific roles, with regard to particular GenAI tools and uses. In smaller
    organisations and start-ups, these key expectations may be more pronounced. This
    shift in skills requirements will not only affect the employment of new graduates,
    but also impact existing job roles at all levels. As such, **we predict** a change
    in expectations for individuals filling roles, especially within the knowledge
    economy, as they begin to integrate GenAI into their work; moreover, while they
    will become more capable, less manpower will be needed over time for existing
    role types and the skill mix for those roles will evolve, for example, with a
    greater emphasis on holistic competencies such as teamwork, leadership skills,
    critical thinking. Different and new types of roles will also emerge, such as
    ‘AI Engineers’, ‘Head of Conversational AI’, ‘AI Ethicists’, ‘Human–Machines Teaming

    feel the impetus to revise and update their curricula to include comprehensive
    AI and GenAI education, ensuring their students are well prepared and competitive
    in the job market after graduation. As such, **we predict** that universities
    will need to, and will, adapt accordingly to introduce these tools into their
    curricula. **We predict** that these changes will happen gradually; initially,
    this will be done on an ad-hoc, teacher-by-teacher basis with light integration,
    perhaps following earlier iterations of institutional policies regarding AI and
    GenAI. However, **we predict** that most institutions will fund and facilitate
    a broader approach towards the deeper integration of these technologies into programme
    curricula, though seeing the impact of this will take more time.

    as facilitated by GenAI, presents an intriguing opportunity. However, the extent
    to which we should embrace such new methodologies, and for institutions to identify
    what will be effective, practical, and feasible, are far from clear. Institutions
    may navigate this transition at different paces and with varying degrees of enthusiasm,
    largely influenced by local educational policies, societal acceptance, and the
    internal readiness for change. With this in mind, **we predict** that the changes
    to assessment will be highly varied between institutions as well as between regions.
    Some will make minimal changes as required and driven by social attitudes and
    the goal of upholding fairness. Some will revert back to proctored exams. Some
    will use this opportunity to make further institutional-wide changes and push
    towards more authentic, innovative, and GenAI-partnered assessment approaches

    postgraduate students, their supervisors, and examiners. Students can leverage
    these tools to act as advisors and mentors to enhance their understanding in their
    chosen research areas. They can employ GenAI to summarise papers, grasp key concepts,
    connect ideas with theories, and come to better understand how these theories
    relate to their own research. GenAI can also help students in the writing process,
    handling tasks including reference formatting, grammar, spelling, and enhancing
    clarity and academic writing styles. Supervisors, too, can utilise these tools
    to swiftly review research proposals or draft theses. Specialised AI or GenAI
    models can help look over research work in great detail, ensuring the appropriateness
    of methodological details, the accuracy and suitability of the data analyses used,
    and even the depth and insightfulness of analytical findings. Examiners and reviewers

    will move towards giving strong support for GenAI adoption and work to implement
    measures to uphold academic integrity, such as by requiring declarations of GenAI
    use and promoting users’ self-regulation using an honour system. **We predict**
    that institutions resistant to this will likely face significant pressure from
    all stakeholders to take action, potentially impacting their ability to attract
    research candidates if the institution is perceived as lagging behind in modern
    research approaches. **We predict** that there may be interesting challenges for
    supervisors and institutions to achieve cross-institutional consistency. This
    may lead to regional or specific agreements made between certain groups of institutions
    in order to establish consistency and an interoperable set of policies that allow

    of the process, highlighting how GenAI can drastically cut down on the workload
    that is otherwise cumbersome for all parties involved in writing and reviewing
    the proposal. In his article, Parrilla contemplates whether grant proposal systems
    can be simplified by eliminating certain components from the proposal content,
    thereby reducing the chances of exploiting GenAI to write these sections. However,
    considering that most grant funds come from public resources or charitable organisations,
    transparency and auditability remain crucial, even many years after the completion
    of the proposed and undertaken research.
