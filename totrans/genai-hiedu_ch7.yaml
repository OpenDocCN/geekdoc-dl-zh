- en: Throughout this book, we have discussed AI in education and Generative AI (GenAI),
    providing an overview of its history and details of the technology. We have presented
    the need for AI literacy and how GenAI can influence curriculum design, assessment,
    and educational policy. We have provided frameworks for defining and guiding changes
    in these areas with the goal of ensuring that desired outcomes are best achieved.
    We have also provided insight into why GenAI has reached a point where it will
    have a transformative impact on education, as well as how educational institutions
    and policymakers should respond.

    the time that we eat to the clothes we wear, or to the use of our mobile phones.
    A society cannot function successfully for long without such social norms influencing
    individual behaviour, and in turn facilitating cohesion and order ([Rachlinski,
    2000](#ref7_20)). By examining the adoption of previous innovations in society,
    we may be able to uncover a model for how AI and GenAI adoption could be similarly
    influenced by, or even reshape, our social norms.

    2000](#ref7_20)）。通过考察社会对以前创新技术的采用，我们可能能够揭示一个模型，说明人工智能和GenAI的采用可能同样受到社会规范的影响，甚至可能重塑我们的社会规范。
- en: If we look back at the adoption of the personal computer (PC) in the 1980s and
    1990s, it was initially a small, yet sizeable group of people who were the early
    users (yes, the nerds!). It was not until much later that such adoption increased.
    One could argue that PCs were initially not hugely useful to the average person
    until after the Internet reached a point where it catered to a sufficiently broad
    set of interests. In the early days of the PC, playing computer games and writing
    simple software were not yet of interest to the majority; moreover, the widespread
    need for tools like spreadsheets and word processors only arose when they reached
    a relatively high level of regular use among the general population. This was
    assisted, or perhaps driven, by the need for these tools and related skills in
    the work environment. Eventually, they also became a necessity in the educational
    system. How many people submitted handwritten reports in the 1990s for their degree
    courses, compared to the current number of people submitting reports in this format?

  zh: 如果我们回顾20世纪80年代和90年代个人电脑(PC)的采用情况，最初只是一小部分人成为了早期用户（是的，那些极客们！）。直到很久以后，这种采用才逐渐增加。有人可能会说，直到互联网发展到足够满足广泛兴趣的程度，个人电脑对普通人来说才变得非常有用。在个人电脑的早期，玩电脑游戏和编写简单的软件对大多数人来说还没有什么兴趣；此外，对电子表格和文字处理等工具的广泛需求只有在它们在普通人群中达到相对较高程度的常规使用时才出现。这在工作环境中对这些工具和相关技能的需求得到了帮助，或者可能是由这些需求推动的。最终，它们也成为了教育系统中的必需品。与现在提交报告的人数相比，有多少人在20世纪90年代为他们的学位课程提交了手写报告？
- en: In 2019, around 47% of households worldwide were reported to have a computer
    ([Statista PCs, 2019](#ref7_22)); this may not seem like a very large percentage,
    but it was possibly impacted by the introduction of smartphones. According to
    Statista, in 2020, 78% of the world’s population owned a smartphone; in 2016,
    it was less than half ([Statista Mobiles, 2019](#ref7_21)). Here, we see a much
    more rapid and broader adoption of smartphones by people across the socio-economic
    landscape. The rise of smartphones has been, in part, due to their usefulness,
    personal nature, handheld-sized convenience akin to having a PC in your pocket,
    and the huge variety of options available in terms of cost and style.

    like spreadsheets to appeal to businesses, and fast Internet connections to appeal
    to the wider public, GenAI stands out for its immediate readiness for use without
    the necessity for additional tools or technologies. However, despite its broad
    array of capabilities, **we predict** that GenAI won’t resonate with as wide a
    proportion of society as mobile phones and smartphone technology have. **We predict**
    that the primary users of AI will be the more educated members of society, regardless
    of their economic backgrounds, with a significant proportion being younger individuals.
    Still, **we predict** GenAI will be rapidly adopted by society, spanning most
    social and economic groups, and also expect that a wide variety of useful GenAI
    tools will be available and accessible (e.g., at zero or low cost options). **We
    predict** that there will be a high diversity of GenAI offerings, including chatbots,
    personal assistants, and a seamless integration of GenAI into word processing
    and text editors similar to how spell or grammar checkers are now integrated into
    these tools. With this broad range of applications, **we also predict** that it

    software development professionals – announced a layoff of up to 28% of their
    staff in the latter half of 2023 ([Davis, 2023](#ref7_9)). Concurrently, they
    unveiled their own AI offering ([Chandrasekar, 2023](#ref7_6)) and a plan to charge
    AI companies for data usage ([Dave, 2023](#ref7_8)). While the layoffs may appear
    sudden and extreme, it is worth noting that Stack Overflow had conducted a significant
    hiring round about 12 months prior; at that time, many other tech companies were
    reducing staff numbers due to the general economic climate. Thus, not all these

- en: The Goldman Sachs report estimated that AI automation would impact work tasks
    in numerous sectors across the US and Europe, affecting 46% of work in the Office
    and Administrative Support sector, 44% of Legal, 37% of Architecture and Engineering,
    and 36% of the Life, Physical, and Social Science areas ([Briggs & Kodnani, 2023a](#ref7_3)).
    The report also emphasised that AI technologies still require human intervention
    and guidance, indicating that not all roles within these sectors would be affected
    equally. It pointed out that work capable of being automated by AI would be more
    prevalent in developed markets than in emerging ones, with Japan, Israel, and
    Hong Kong being the most highly impacted. The report further underscored that
    any new jobs created would constitute the bulk of employment growth during such
    a transition into greater automation of tasks. For instance, of the current US
    employment rate, only 40% are in occupations that have existed since 1940, while
    60% are in occupations that emerged thereafter.

    not necessarily jeopardise anyone’s jobs – only the individual working that job,
    who will need to keep up to date with the necessary skills and knowledge to best
    leverage GenAI for their work – and that, overall, it will likely be perceived

- en: As such, **our prediction** is that any negative impacts on employment will
    neither slow nor significantly affect GenAI adoption. **We also predict** that
    GenAI will impact roles in the knowledge-based economy more than, say, manual
    labour-based roles, and that those in these knowledge-based jobs are more likely
    to be the early users of GenAI. This results in the impacted workforce being in
    a better position, due to their relatively high level of education, to adapt to
    the new reality more than ever before. These changes will be hard to measure,
    and the impact on key job numbers will not be obvious, similar to the case of
    the ‘The Great Attrition’ during the pandemic in the US ([Ellingrud et al., 2023](#ref7_10)).
    **We predict** that, ultimately, there will be an increase in the number of people
    employed in the knowledge economy due to the additional roles, companies, and
    needs that currently do not even exist, growing vastly more than the consolidation
    that will happen on existing roles due to efficiencies allowed by AI. **We also

    等人，2023](#ref7_10)）。**我们预测**，最终，由于新增的角色、公司和需求，知识经济中的就业人数将增加，这远远超过由于人工智能带来的效率而发生的现有角色的整合。**我们还预测**，未来的知识经济将涉及比以往任何时候都更加强大的综合能力和知识技能的结合。
- en: Currently, many industries are embracing GenAI, from software development companies
    to legal services firms. Their adoption of this technology is happening rapidly,
    especially in smaller organisations. Larger organisations, on the other hand,
    are proceeding more cautiously due to concerns surrounding commercial privacy,
    trust, and risk. They need to understand the legal risks and potential liabilities
    given the novelty of this technology and the areas of law that it may touch. For
    example, could they, through their use of GenAI models, potentially have liabilities
    due to copyright issues arising from how the model is trained by its developers
    (e.g., the copyright issue of using Harry Potter works by OpenAI in their products;
    [Usman, 2023](#ref7_25))? Still, despite the slower pace of integration among
    larger organisations, it seems that their full embracing of GenAI will just be
    a matter of time. This could be expedited if AI product companies address enterprise
    concerns with specific offerings that cater to their risk appetite, or if these
    enterprises become more comfortable with the risks involved, drawing from their
    previous experiences with technologies like cloud computing or outsourcing services.

  zh: 人工智能和通用人工智能的出现极大地扩展了研究生、他们的导师和考官可用的资源。学生可以利用这些工具作为顾问和导师，以增强他们在所选研究领域的理解。他们可以使用通用人工智能来总结论文、掌握关键概念、将思想与理论联系起来，并更好地理解这些理论与他们自己的研究之间的关系。通用人工智能还可以在写作过程中帮助学生，包括处理参考文献格式、语法、拼写，并增强清晰度和学术写作风格。导师也可以利用这些工具快速审查研究提案或起草论文。专门的AI或通用人工智能模型可以帮助详细审查研究工作，确保方法细节的适当性、数据分析的准确性和适用性，甚至分析发现的深度和洞察力。考官和审稿人也可以从中受益，其中通用人工智能可以用来检查文献综述的彻底性并评估所提出发现的创新性。
- en: Overall, AI and GenAI enables everyone involved in research processes to save
    time, increase efficiency, and enhance the quality of their work. The adoption
    and extent of GenAI utilisation will largely depend on institutional policies
    concerning such technology. **We predict** that higher education institutions
    will move towards giving strong support for GenAI adoption and work to implement
    measures to uphold academic integrity, such as by requiring declarations of GenAI
    use and promoting users’ self-regulation using an honour system. **We predict**
    that institutions resistant to this will likely face significant pressure from
    all stakeholders to take action, potentially impacting their ability to attract
    research candidates if the institution is perceived as lagging behind in modern
    research approaches. **We predict** that there may be interesting challenges for
    supervisors and institutions to achieve cross-institutional consistency. This
    may lead to regional or specific agreements made between certain groups of institutions
    in order to establish consistency and an interoperable set of policies that allow
    for easier cross-institution collaboration.

    drafting grant applications. [Parrilla (2023)](#ref7_19) provides an overview
    of the process, highlighting how GenAI can drastically cut down on the workload
    that is otherwise cumbersome for all parties involved in writing and reviewing
    the proposal. In his article, Parrilla contemplates whether grant proposal systems
    can be simplified by eliminating certain components from the proposal content,
    thereby reducing the chances of exploiting GenAI to write these sections. However,
    considering that most grant funds come from public resources or charitable organisations,
    transparency and auditability remain crucial, even many years after the completion
    of the proposed and undertaken research.

    to healthcare must respond to, but the sector perhaps most at risk of disruption
    is education [¹](#list7_6_1). Generative AI is not necessarily a death knell for
    education, but educators must be taught how to engage with it effectively [¹](#list7_6_1).
    More than 90% of teachers said they had never had any training in or even advice
    on how to use generative AI in school [¹](#list7_6_1). To ensure it is a net benefit
    to society and the education sector, we must stop being afraid of this technology
    and instead think hard about how to use it best [¹](#list7_6_1).Generative AI
    has the potential to disrupt or augment how we think and act. It could modify
    present and future generations’ cognition because human socialisation and organic,
    human pedagogies are being replaced with artificial tutors and automated feedback
    loops [¹](#list7_6_1). However, young people know that information can be found
    online. Students today risk being criticised for using their phones to look up
    answers online on Wikipedia, not because the answer is wrong, but because they
    used the internet to find it. Trying to stop them from accessing it is problematic,
    to say the least [¹](#list7_6_1).As generative AI becomes more widespread, accessible
    and easy to use, it will continue to impact the way we engage in teaching, learning,
    and assessment in higher education [²](#list7_6_2). UCL has opted to promote ethical
    and transparent engagement with GenAI tools rather than seek to ban them [²](#list7_6_2).
    In this paper, the authors explore the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on assessing
    student work in further education contexts. As GenAI becomes widely adopted, it
    engenders potential risks to assessment, such as false evidence of learning, student
    vulnerability to academic integrity injustice, and implications for independent
    learning and creativity [³](#list7_6_3). This study explores university students’
    perceptions of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, in higher
    education, focusing on familiarity, their willingness to engage, potential benefits
    and challenges, and effective integration [⁴](#list7_6_4).It’s important to note

  zh: 7.6 结论
- en: GenAI has numerous applications, ranging from assisting with everyday tasks
    to more specialised areas of use. The usefulness of GenAI will drive the adoption
    of this technology in society, eventually becoming part of the social norm, similar
    to how we perceive smartphones today.

  zh: 生成式AI有众多应用，从协助日常任务到更专业领域的使用。生成式AI的实用性将推动社会对这项技术的采用，最终成为社会规范的一部分，就像我们今天看待智能手机一样。
- en: Industry is adapting, and will continue to adopt and adapt, to GenAI and the
    benefits and challenges it comes with. Generally speaking, employees who do so
    quickly will be able to benefit more from the momentum, and new employees at all
    levels will need to acquire the skills in GenAI use and literacy. In particular,
    the integration of GenAI into roles and industries within the knowledge economy
    – where the creation, acquisition, and application of knowledge and information
    drive economic growth and development – will put pressure on educational institutions
    to incorporate GenAI skills and capabilities within the curriculum so that new
    graduates are prepared for the real world.

  zh: 行业正在适应，并将继续采用和适应生成式人工智能及其带来的利益和挑战。一般来说，那些迅速适应的员工将能够从这种动力中获得更多好处，而所有级别的新的员工都需要掌握生成式人工智能的使用和素养技能。特别是，将生成式人工智能整合到知识经济中的角色和行业中——在这些行业中，知识和信息的创造、获取和应用推动经济增长和发展——将对教育机构施加压力，要求在课程中融入生成式人工智能的技能和能力，以便新毕业生为现实世界做好准备。
- en: Government regulations will vary from region to region; however, in general,
    the potential for advancement and innovation in technology and leadership afforded
    by AI means that under-regulation is more probable than over-regulation. In cases
    where over-regulation occurs, there will likely be considerable pressure to quickly
    lessen or revert the constraints.

  zh: 政府法规将因地区而异；然而，总的来说，由人工智能带来的技术进步和领导力创新潜力意味着，过度监管的可能性大于不足监管。在出现过度监管的情况下，可能会出现巨大的压力，要求迅速减轻或撤销限制。
- en: In university education, the greatest pressure will be to adjust to the changing
    marketplace and societal expectations, ensuring that graduates are ready and equipped
    with the necessary skills to effectively utilise these tools once they enter the
    job market. Changes in assessment will be needed, to align with the changing landscape
    and to ensure fairness. Postgraduate students will adopt these technologies in
    their research and work, subject to individual institutional policies.

- en: In the case of research, the biggest impact will be felt in the practices of
    peer-reviewed journals. There is potential for the development of specialised
    AI tools and models that will assist authors, editors, and reviewers, as well
    as drive change in the industry towards greater transparency and openness, putting
    greater emphasis on scientific validation, impact, and verification rather than
    on peer opinion.

- en: As these changes occur, it is likely that there will be considerable ‘drama’
    at times as workforces change, as the technology is used in unexpected ways, as
    new discoveries are made, or as issues are detected with already-published works.
    Sometimes the disruptions will be justified; however, most of the time, it will
    be a storm in a teacup given the overall landscape and changes on the horizon
    for humanity.

- en: Finally, **we speculate** that AI *won’t* be able to predict the future any
    better than humans can for most events that will unfold in the world, and this
    is an important thing to remember. We should not trust AI any more than a trusted
    friend who is not an expert. Even blind trust in an expert is not advisable; we
    need to use our judgement and sharpen our critical thinking skills to make informed
    decisions. With that being said, we will wait and observe with keen interest to
    see if any of these predictions come to fruition, and whether they were foreseen
    by our own speculative efforts or perhaps through the predictive capabilities
    of GenAI.
