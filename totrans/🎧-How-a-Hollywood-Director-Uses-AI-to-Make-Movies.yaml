    with experience working with brands like HP and Intel who is now experimenting
    with cutting-edge AI technology. He recently produced a popular sci-fi short called
    [*Borrowing Time*,](https://twitter.com/Diesol/status/1747351624329355474) which
    has over 110,000 views on X and was [mentioned in *Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2024/01/18/the-worst-funding-news-in-tech-leias-new-ceo-cinematic-ai/?sh=1984b8631858).
    Dave made this film, complete with an intricate storyline and a rich set of characters,
    only using AI tools like Midjourney, text-to-video model [Runway](https://runwayml.com/),
    and generative voice AI platform [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/).

    expensive project that traditional Hollywood studios would never bankroll. But
    after Dave‚Äôs short went viral, major production houses approached him to make
    it a full-length movie. I think this is an excellent example of [how AI is changing
    the art of filmmaking](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/sora-and-the-future-of-filmmaking),
    and I came out of this interview convinced that we are on the brink of a new creative
    age.

    how aspiring filmmakers can use them to validate their ideas, and potentially
    even secure funding if they get traction. Dave walks me through how he has integrated
    AI into his movie-making process, and as we talk, we make a short film featuring
    Nicolas Cage using a haunted roulette ball to resurrect his dead movie career,
    live on the show.
