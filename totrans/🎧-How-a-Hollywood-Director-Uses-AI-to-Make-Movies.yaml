    with experience working with brands like HP and Intel who is now experimenting
    with cutting-edge AI technology. He recently produced a popular sci-fi short called
    [*Borrowing Time*,](https://twitter.com/Diesol/status/1747351624329355474) which
    has over 110,000 views on X and was [mentioned in *Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2024/01/18/the-worst-funding-news-in-tech-leias-new-ceo-cinematic-ai/?sh=1984b8631858).
    Dave made this film, complete with an intricate storyline and a rich set of characters,
    only using AI tools like Midjourney, text-to-video model [Runway](https://runwayml.com/),
    and generative voice AI platform [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/).

- en: Dave told me that he couldn‚Äôt have made *Borrowing Time* without AI‚Äîit‚Äôs an
    expensive project that traditional Hollywood studios would never bankroll. But
    after Dave‚Äôs short went viral, major production houses approached him to make
    it a full-length movie. I think this is an excellent example of [how AI is changing
    the art of filmmaking](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/sora-and-the-future-of-filmmaking),
    and I came out of this interview convinced that we are on the brink of a new creative
    age.

    how aspiring filmmakers can use them to validate their ideas, and potentially
    even secure funding if they get traction. Dave walks me through how he has integrated
    AI into his movie-making process, and as we talk, we make a short film featuring
    Nicolas Cage using a haunted roulette ball to resurrect his dead movie career,
    live on the show.

    been a risky, expensive business reserved for rich industry insiders. Dave believes
    AI is democratizing the process, empowering him to visualize his sci-fi short
    and ‚Äútest the waters with these techniques.‚Äù ‚Äú[E]veryone has a chance to create
    something incredible,‚Äù he says.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Voice all your characters using AI.** AI filmmaking tools are also empowering
    because they allow creators to dub full movies by themselves. Dave, who is Black,
    used [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)‚Äôs new [speech-to-speech feature](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/speech-to-speech/)
    to voice all the characters in his sci-fi short. He explains that ‚Äúthe white judge
    in the movie was my voice...and the woman, the mother, was my voice.‚Äù'

- en: '**Boost AI clips by altering frame rates.** These video-generation tools are
    still limited by the maximum length of the clips you can generate. To counter
    this, Dave uses [Topaz Labs](https://www.topazlabs.com/) to alter the ‚Äúframe rate‚Äù
    (in simple terms, the frequency at which consecutive images are displayed in the
    video) of the clips he generates with [Runway](https://runwayml.com/). ‚Äú[W]hat
    I''m able to do is make clips last longer and then mix that with quicker cut clips,
    so it actually makes the‚Ä¶filmmaking more like something we''re used to seeing
    on TV,‚Äù he says.'

    on his personal creative style to make a movie. The GPT, called BlasianGPT to
    represent Dave‚Äôs Black and Asian heritage, is a text-to-image generator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    GPT, BlasianGPT, because it curates image styles based on his tastes, taking on
    the role of a ‚Äúmentor.‚Äù ‚Äú[W]hat you''re able to do, which is incredible, is really
    fine tune it to the type of imagery you like to create. And you don''t have to
    pigeonhole it‚Ä¶you can make it as vast as you want,‚Äù he explains.'

    a different path, and Dave prompts BlasianGPT to create the next scene. ‚ÄúI typically

    he says. We also ask GPT about the backstory of objects in these images to give
    us ideas.'

    next frame, we find ourselves constructing a story, reminding Dave of the advantage
    text-to-image GPTs have over Midjourney, which doesn‚Äôt have a chatbot: ‚Äú[Y]ou''re
    telling a story together and you''re really detailed in your narration‚Ä¶It''s almost

    a detailed prompt to use in Midjourney,‚Äù he says.'
