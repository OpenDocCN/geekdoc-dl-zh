    learning applications and essential scientific computation techniques, respectively.
    Before though, in this first part, we are going to learn about `torch`’s basic
    building blocks: tensors, automatic differentiation, optimizers, and modules.
    I’d call this part “`torch` basics”, or, following a common template, “Getting
    started with `torch`”, were it not for a certain false impression this could create.
    These are basics, true, but basics in the sense of *foundations*: Having worked
    through the next chapters, you’ll have solid conceptions about how `torch` works,
    and you’ll have seen enough code to feel comfortable experimenting with the more
    involved examples encountered in later sections. In other words, you’ll be, to
    some degree, *fluent* in `torch`.'

    One version will involve just raw tensors and their in-built capabilities, while
    the other will make use of dedicated `torch` structures that encapsulate, in an
    object-oriented way, functionality essential to neural network training. As a
    consequence, you’ll be excellently equipped for part two, where we’ll see how
    to apply deep learning to different tasks and domains.'
