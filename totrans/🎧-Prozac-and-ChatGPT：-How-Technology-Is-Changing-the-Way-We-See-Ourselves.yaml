    [*Listening to Prozac*](https://www.amazon.com/Listening-Prozac-Landmark-Antidepressants-Remaking/dp/0140266712),
    which is an international bestseller. He has practiced psychiatry and taught psychotherapy

    can change who we are](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-the-human-mind)even
    if it comes as a software product rather than a pill. It‚Äôs undoubtedly true that
    as generations of humans learn to live with AI, it will change what it means to
    be human‚Äîand how we see ourselves and the world. I think that can be a good thing,
    but it could also be scary.

    Kramer writes that panic attacks were once an uncommon occurrence until a drug
    to treat them, Xanax, became widely available. ‚ÄúI think we really do see things
    that we have solutions for more,‚Äù Dr. Kramer says, an insight I share because
    ever since I noticed ChatGPT‚Äôs adeptness at summarizing, I see opportunities to
    summarize everywhere, from writing articles to framing emails.'

    also delves into how the discovery of lithium, which effectively treats manic
    depression but generally not schizophrenia, created a distinction between the
    two disorders. He explains that ‚Äútechnologies‚Ä¶seem to be illuminating about how
    human experience ought to be subdivided,‚Äù just as tools like ChatGPT are reframing
    the parts of ourselves, including our intelligence, that we perceive as uniquely
    human.'

    about AI‚Äôs ability to advise people on these matters based on its understanding
    of the consequences of human behavior. We put ChatGPT to the test in the exploratory
    segment of the interview, where my guest and I experiment with ChatGPT together.

    psychiatrist Dr. Peter D. Kramer while advising us.
