- en: 'Thinking back, it seems almost mad that we even attempted to write a book in
    just eight months – especially during the last eight months I have been very busy
    with new responsibilities, having taken up the directorship of the newly structured
    teaching and learning centre at my university. On top of that, the ever-evolving
    landscape of Generative AI (GenAI)—with its constant introduction of new apps,
    regulations, functions, and guidelines – kept setting us backwards from our finishing
    line, forcing us to keep up with the latest developments. I remember my co-author
    Tom telling me, “We need to revise the chapter again! Did you hear that ChatGPT
    can now recognise images?” As much as I wanted to exclaim, “Wow, cool!” my actual
    response was, “Oh, no!” Despite that, our commitment remained: we wanted to bring
    the latest ideas, news, and practices to our readers, and we felt compelled to
    stay ahead of the curve. Thus, you will find very up-to-date news and references
    in the book. The content in some chapters is so cutting-edge that our primary
    sources were online forums, substack, LinkedIn, Facebook teachers’ groups, Twitter
    (X), newspapers, and YouTube; we must have joined so many Facebook, LinkedIn forums
    and discussion groups, and, naturally, engaged in extensive discussions with colleagues
    from universities and industries worldwide.'

  zh: 回想起来，我们竟然在短短八个月内尝试撰写一本书，这似乎有些疯狂——尤其是在过去的八个月里，我非常忙碌于新的职责，担任了我所在大学新组建的教学与学习中心的主任。除此之外，通用人工智能（GenAI）不断变化的格局——包括新应用的推出、法规、功能和指南的引入——不断将我们推向终点线，迫使我们跟上最新的发展。我记得我的合著者汤姆告诉我，“我们需要再次修订章节！你听到ChatGPT现在可以识别图像了吗？”尽管我想要大声喊出，“哇，太酷了！”但我的实际反应是，“哦，不！”尽管如此，我们的承诺依然存在：我们希望将最新的想法、新闻和实践带给读者，我们感到有必要保持领先。因此，你会在书中找到非常最新的新闻和参考资料。有些章节的内容如此前沿，以至于我们的主要来源是在线论坛、substack、LinkedIn、Facebook教师群组、Twitter（X）、报纸和YouTube；我们可能加入了如此多的Facebook、LinkedIn论坛和讨论组，并且自然地与来自世界各地的大学和行业同仁进行了广泛的讨论。
- en: Being at the top-ranking university in Asia and the world, we often hold the
    centre stage. Given that the University of Hong Kong is the first university to
    have an AI policy and assessment guidelines in place (as far as we know), it was
    expected that news reporters would be interested in our work. Apart from the book,
    I also conducted a number of research projects in this area, and put together
    an AI literacy online course an assessment guidebook and infographics and leaflets
    on GenAI assessment (please visit the AI in education website at [https://aied.talic.hku.hk/](https://aied.talic.hku.hk)).
    Looking around and speaking to the publisher, we believe this book will be the
    first on GenAI in higher education.

  zh: 作为亚洲和世界顶尖的大学，我们常常处于舞台的中心。鉴于香港大学是我们所知的第一所制定人工智能政策和评估指南的大学，因此预期新闻记者会对我们的工作感兴趣。除了这本书，我还在这个领域进行了一系列的研究项目，并汇编了人工智能素养在线课程、评估指南手册以及关于通用人工智能评估的图表和传单（请访问人工智能教育网站
    [https://aied.talic.hku.hk/](https://aied.talic.hku.hk)）。环顾四周并与出版商交谈，我们相信这本书将是第一本关于高等教育中通用人工智能的书籍。
- en: While this book is primarily for educators, I felt it would’ be incomplete without
    including the technical side of GenAI. Therefore, I invited Tom as my co-author.
    I am grateful to him, joining me in writing this book to check up on my AI know-how,
    making sure the tech parts are sound, given his current expertise in this domain.
    I must admit my technical background is a bit out-of-date.

  zh: 虽然这本书主要是为教育工作者编写的，但我感觉如果不包括通用人工智能的技术方面，这本书就会显得不完整。因此，我邀请了汤姆作为我的合著者。我非常感激他加入我，共同撰写这本书，检查我的人工智能知识，确保技术部分准确无误，鉴于他在这个领域的当前专业知识。我必须承认，我的技术背景有点过时。
- en: As educators, we are always talking about an interdisciplinary focus, many bachelor
    programmes are no longer just a degree majoring in one discipline area but many.
    This book is interdisciplinary by nature; together, my co-author and I encompass
    both the educational and technical aspects. By merging education and engineering,
    we reflect the multi-faceted world we inhabit. Moreover, GenAI fosters collaboration
    across disciplines. Hence, this book contains examples from all disciplines, assisting
    readers in grasping the expansive world of GenAI and interdisciplinarity.

  zh: 作为教育工作者，我们总是谈论跨学科的关注点，许多学士学位课程不再是单一学科领域的学位专业，而是多个。这本书本质上就是跨学科的；我和我的合著者共同涵盖了教育和技术两个方面。通过将教育和工程相结合，我们反映了我们所居住的多面世界。此外，通用人工智能促进了跨学科的协作。因此，这本书包含了来自所有学科的例子，帮助读者掌握通用人工智能和跨学科的广阔世界。
- en: In the book, we tried to use as many examples as we can to illustrate the different
    aspects of the power of GenAI. Knowing the readers of this book may be teachers,
    educational developers, policy writers from various disciplinary backgrounds and
    different types of post-secondary education institutions (such as community, vocational
    and technical colleges, research-intensive, and teaching-intensive universities),
    we made it a point to use straightforward language and terms that are not specific
    to educational research, and we hope that we have managed to make it readable
    and approachable for all readers.

  zh: 在这本书中，我们尽量使用尽可能多的例子来展示通用人工智能（GenAI）的各个方面。考虑到这本书的读者可能是教师、来自不同学科背景的教育开发者、政策制定者以及不同类型的后高等教育机构（如社区学院、职业技术学院、研究型大学和教学型大学），我们特意使用直白易懂的语言和术语，避免使用特定于教育研究的术语，并希望我们已成功使这本书对所有读者都易于阅读和接近。
- en: GenAI’s role in education is so new for the majority, we want to help readers
    to try out this new tool, not to be afraid of it, but to embrace it. Thus, wherever
    possible, we include examples, and even provide ‘try-it-out’ prompts so readers
    can test them out. Any changes are not easy for our teachers, staff and policymakers;
    this book also raises the challenges not to underestimate the workload and hurdles
    through which teachers and supporting staff must jump. GenAI is driving us to
    revolutionise assessment in education. Recognising this transformative potential,
    in [Chapter 4](ch4.xhtml), we have developed an AI Assessment Integration Framework,
    together with an array of strategies and scenarios to effectively partner with
    GenAI in this domain. Since May, when a research article I authored on AI policy
    was published, I have been contacted by over 200 universities to discuss about
    how to devise an AI policy. Thus, in [Chapter 5](ch5.xhtml), we provide a step-by-step
    guide on how to devise an AI policy; in fact, we gave an example of what an AI
    policy should look like. Of course, if you wish to know more, please do contact
    us.

  zh: 对于大多数人来说，通用人工智能在教育中的作用是如此新颖，我们希望帮助读者尝试这个新工具，不要害怕它，而是要拥抱它。因此，在可能的情况下，我们包括了一些例子，甚至提供了“试试看”的提示，以便读者可以亲自测试它们。对于我们的教师、员工和政策制定者来说，任何变化都不是一件容易的事情；这本书也提出了不要低估教师和辅助人员必须跨越的工作量和障碍的挑战。通用人工智能正在推动我们对教育评估进行革命。认识到这种变革潜力，在第四章中，我们开发了一个AI评估集成框架，以及一系列策略和场景，以有效地与通用人工智能在这个领域合作。自从五月份我发表的一篇关于AI政策的文章发表以来，我已经收到了200多所大学的联系，讨论如何制定AI政策。因此，在第五章中，我们提供了如何制定AI政策的逐步指南；实际上，我们提供了一个AI政策应该是什么样的例子。当然，如果您想了解更多信息，请随时联系我们。
- en: The examples, case studies, and focus of the book are written for post-secondary
    education; however, most of the content is suitable for different levels of education.
    School teachers and principals can adapt some of the strategies to suit the culture
    of their students and environments.

  zh: 这本书的例子、案例研究和重点是针对后高等教育编写的；然而，大部分内容适合不同层次的教育。学校教师和校长可以根据学生的文化和环境调整一些策略。
- en: Each chapter begins with a quote that relates to the theme of the chapter, and
    the structure of the main body may differ depending on the theme of each chapter.
    The chapter ends with a section called *questions to ponder* and we included our
    own personal reflection after completing each chapter which diverges from the
    conventions of a typical academic book. This book is written for everyone – academic
    developers, researchers, teachers, policymakers, students, IT and administrative
    staff, and parents. There are lots of useful “freshly out of the oven” research,
    guidelines, examples, frameworks and practices from this book and it may help
    to contemplate the kind of findings that are needed to support these practices
    and to generate theories and frameworks. The questions and reflections at the
    end of each chapter may also inspire research questions. At the end of the preliminary
    pages is a short summary of each chapter.

  zh: 每一章都以与章节主题相关的引言开始，正文的结构可能根据每一章的主题而有所不同。章节结束时，会有一个名为*思考问题*的部分，并在完成每一章后包含我们自己的个人反思，这与典型学术书籍的惯例有所不同。这本书是为所有人而写的——学术开发者、研究人员、教师、政策制定者、学生、IT和行政人员，以及家长。这本书中包含了许多有用的“新鲜出炉”的研究、指南、示例、框架和实践，它可能有助于思考支持这些实践和生成理论框架所需的研究成果。每一章结尾的问题和反思也可能激发研究问题。在初步页面的最后，是对每一章的简要总结。
