    There will be two categories of things to dive into: topics workflow-related,
    and topics related to domain adaptation.'

- en: Secondly – beyond an efficient workflow – the task in question matters. Compositions
    of linear layers, of the type we used to learn `torch` in the first part, will
    not suffice when our goal is to model images or time series. Successful use of
    deep learning means tailoring model architecture to the domain in question. To
    that end, we start from concrete tasks, and present applicable architectures directly
    by example.

- en: 'Concretely, the plan is the following. The upcoming two chapters will introduce
    you to workflow-related techniques that are indispensable in practice. You’ll
    encounter another package, `luz`, that endows `torch` with an important layer
    of abstraction, and significantly streamlines the workflow. Once you know how
    to use it, we’re all set to look at a first application: image classification.
    To improve on our initial results, we then back up and explore two more advanced
    workflow-related topics: how to improve generalization, and how to speed up training.
    Equipped with that knowledge, we first return to images, before extending our
    domain-related skills to tabular data, time series, and audio.'
