- en: Alan is the cofounder and CEO of [Hume](https://www.hume.ai/), an AI research
    laboratory developing models trained to identify and measure expressions of emotion
    from voice inflections and facial expressions. The best part? Once it understands
    these emotions, the AI is designed to interact with users in a way that optimizes
    for human well-being and leaves them with a positive emotional experience.

    research into affective computing, a field focused on developing technologies
    that can understand and respond to human emotions. He operates at the intersection
    of AI and psychology, and I sat down with him to understand the inner workings
    of Hume’s models. Alan walks me through the shortcomings of traditional theories
    of emotional science and breaks down how Hume is addressing these challenges.
    While talking about the potential applications of the models, we also discuss
    the tricky ethical concerns that come with creating an AI that can interpret human
    emotions.

    which we can understand people’s hidden desires. “Your preference is whatever
    is going to make you happier or more awe-inspiring or amused…understanding people''s
    emotional reactions is really key to learning how to satisfy people''s preferences,”

    hidden desires, the way we speak, coupled with the language we use, can reveal
    our emotions. “So [voice inflexions are] something that just accompanies every

    the voice versus language alone,” Alan explains.'

    or ‘surprise,’ and in the U.K., people said ‘fear’ and ‘surprise’—we wouldn''t
    say people in the U.S. and U.K. actually experience different emotions, it just
    turns out that they use different words as their basic vocabulary instinctively,”

    we take a step back to understand how Alan thinks about the theories around emotions.
    We start by discussing the way science has traditionally divided up emotions into
    a discrete number of categories or dimensions.

    identifies six basic emotions—happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise—that
    he proposes are universally experienced and recognized across all human cultures.
    According to Ekman, these emotions are hardwired into our biology and are expressed
    through universally consistent facial expressions.'

    suggests emotions are built from two dimensions: valence (how pleasant or unpleasant
    something is) and arousal (the level of energy or activation). Barrett argues
    that our brain interprets sensory inputs using these dimensions, and then constructs
    the specific emotions we feel based on the context and our past experiences.'

- en: Hume’s research is driven by the belief that both of these theories fail to
    map the full spectrum of emotional experiences because they are based on presumed
    categories or dimensions of emotion. For this reason, the Hume team has developed
    a new approach called the semantic space theory.

    is best understood in the way it is different from the traditional theories discussed
    earlier. Instead of assuming the existence of certain types of emotions, it examines
    emotional responses and maps the dimensions of emotional experiences. Alan explains,
    “The general approach of emotion scientists has been, ‘Let''s posit what emotions
    are and then study them in a confirmatory way,’ and semantic space theory is doing
    something different: ‘Let''s posit the kinds of ways we can conceptualize emotions
    and then derive from the data how many dimensions there are, what the best way
    to talk about them is, how people refer to them across cultures and so forth.’”'

- en: '**Identifying similarities across cultures**. While measuring emotion through
    facial expressions, the team found that there is consistency among the emotional
    experiences of culturally diverse people. “[W]hen you take out the labels, you
    realize that there''s more cultural consistency, which implies that expressions
    have similar meanings and the language actually imposes more cultural differences
    on how those meanings are interpreted and what''s salient to people depending
    on what kinds of experiences they''ve had in life,” Alan remarks.'

- en: '**Accounting for individual differences**. The Hume team unearthed similarities
    among cultures, but their model is also trained to account for individual idiosyncrasies
    by analyzing subtle behavioral cues. “[I]n order to be able to make good predictions,
    [the model] appreciate[s] individual differences and resting facial expressions
    and resting voices and how people modulate their voices over time and so forth,”
    Alan says.'

    “truly understand[s] what humans want,” “measure the impact” that it would have

- en: '**AI that people love talking to**. Since Hume is optimized to give the people
    it interacts with positive emotional experiences, Alan thinks potential use cases
    for the model include customer service, a character in a video game, and some
    version of a therapist app. “[P]eople talk to it in a kind of a way they might
    talk to a therapist or a friend and really get something out of it because it''s
    already optimized for people to be satisfied coming out of the conversation, and
    naturally it does these things that people enjoy,” he explains.'

    it can manipulate you to be sympathetic to it in ways that are inappropriate,”
