<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Nikita Goryachev, a Senior AI/ML Engineer at Sber. My team implements SOTA algorithms in NLP and recommendation systems. We organize industry meetups, participate in conferences (RecSys in Singapore, AI Journey in Moscow), and develop RePlay — an open-source library for recommendations.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-book">About the Book</h2>
<p>This book is a practical guide for data scientists, ML engineers, developers, and anyone working with modern AI. We explore LLMs, conversational AI, and LLM integration into development processes, with a focus on LLMOps (MLOps for Large Language Models). The goal is to provide clear tools and approaches to harness AI's potential in practice.</p>
<p>The approaches and examples are practical: how to embed LLMs in business scenarios (customer support with chatbots, personalization with recommendations, efficiency improvements with MLOps). The book helps bridge the gap between complex technologies and practice, showing how to use AI for growth and value.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-openai-api-fundamentals">Chapter 1: OpenAI API Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Introduction to ChatGPT API: capabilities, classification, and applications. Overview of advanced moderation, enhanced machine reasoning, prompt chaining, and building and evaluating LLM applications.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-conversational-chatbots-with-langchain">Chapter 2: Conversational Chatbots with LangChain</h2>
<p>Practical chatbot development with LangChain: from environment setup to advanced retrieval. Special attention to context and dialogue memory for "human-like" interactions.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-llmops">Chapter 3: LLMOps</h2>
<p>Structured guide to integrating LLMs into dev workflows: model selection and tuning, deployment, monitoring, automation, and best practices. Practical cases and ethical aspects.</p>
<p>This book is not just a collection of techniques, but a comprehensive guide to responsible and innovative AI use. Here you'll find technical, ethical, and practical aspects, as well as a roadmap for development in the rapidly changing world of LLMOps.</p>
