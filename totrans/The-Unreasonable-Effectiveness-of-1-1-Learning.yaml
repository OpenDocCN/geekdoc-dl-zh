    article from our archive that I think is increasingly important. This one is about
    why 1-1 tutoring is so wildly effective—and how you can use it to learn anything.
    I originally wrote it almost a year ago, before tools like ChatGPT and GPT-4 were
    around. At the time, I argued that you could hire someone for surprisingly little
    money to be your personal tutor and learn anything. But with the advent of AI—this
    gets dramatically easier. Personalized tutoring is going to be broadly available
    to anyone with an internet connection and $20 / month. I think that''s a* ***great***
    *world to be in.*'

    paying for the status of the degree, the ability to participate in the community,
    a planned course list and curriculum, the quality control that the university
    provides, and on and on. You’re paying for a turn-key, minimum effort experience.

    primarily for learning—you can learn anything 98% better than you would in a class,
    for significantly less money. The way to do this is through 1-1 tutoring.'

    novel. So I had the author of one of my favorite books tutor me on fiction writing.
    I made more progress during those tutoring sessions than I had in workshops, classes,
    and solo learning combined. And I spent far less money on it than I would have
    spent on an MFA.

    two sigma—98%—better than students who learned through a traditional classroom

    writing blog posts. You need to learn about scenes and structure and dialog and
    character development and plot and a thousand other things. When I realized this

    my writing and my career than the rest of the students, and my questions and problems
    were different. It’s not that I was better at writing, but I had a set of skills
    that I knew were lacking and specific problems in the draft of my novel that I

    Jack Cheng that blew my mind. It was exactly like the kind of book I wanted to
    learn how to write in terms of character, structure, and voice. I’d talked to
    Jack once via a friend of a friend, so I had his email.

    up to this point. The reason is simple: I’d already done a lot of work on my novel,
    built up a decent amount of skill, but I was stuck in a few places and didn’t
    know how to build skill around them. Jack could help me identify where I was stuck
    and suggest things to try that would help—and he often solved problems with a
    few minutes of his time that I had been banging my head against for a year.'

    class. I had to bring a lot more to the table to get what I wanted out of the
    experience. When you’re doing tutoring with someone who doesn’t teach professionally
    they won’t have a course structure or plan. So I had to suggest a structure, bring
    work in that I wanted to review, identify skills I wanted to build, and follow
    through by making progress on my own between tutoring sessions.

    no matter what you want to learn. So, let’s talk about how to do this, how to

    If you want to learn any kind of academic topic then someone pursuing a master’s
    or a PhD in that area is an ideal candidate. Same thing for someone in the arts—a
    recent MFA grad, or someone who has just started to create successful work in

    First of all, if you’re working with someone who is a professional in their field
    you’re going to demonstrate that you’re worth their time. Sure, you’re paying
    them, but teaching isn’t their full-time job. They’re much more likely to find
    it appealing to tutor someone who has some basic knowledge and demonstrated willingness
    to expend effort in a subject area than someone who is coming in completely cold.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, if your tutor isn’t a professional teacher, expecting them to come up
    with a syllabus and a plan for a “course” might be a tall order—so instead you’ll
    need to take charge of what you want to learn and why. Having some basic background
    knowledge will give you an idea of what’s confusing and what you want to get out
    of your experience. This will allow you to guide the tutor in the right direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So before you get a tutor, try to get somewhere on your own first. Not only
    will this make you more likely to be able to work with someone that has a decent
    amount of knowledge and skill, it will also better prepare you to get something
    out of working with them. You’ll be able to come into your tutoring sessions with
    specific questions, or things you want to learn about which will make the process
    significantly more efficient than coming in cold.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This might seem like a lot of work—and it’s not for everyone. If you want to
    do less work you might consider paying for a class, or paying more for a tutor
    with higher expectations about what they’ll bring to the table. There are lots
    of options and degrees of freedom in how you structure things.

    or creative career to teach in order to help support themselves. Unfortunately,
    they’re usually only teaching through a university or some other large organization
    that charges students a lot and pays the teachers very little.
  prefs: []

    that’s likely more than they would get teaching through a big organization, but

    someone who costs something like $50-$100 an hour. My recommendation is, once
    someone has agreed to do tutoring, just ask what they think is reasonable—and
    if it’s something you can afford go with that.

    Every two weeks was nice because it gave me time to do a revision of a scene,
    and would give him enough time to review it before we met again.

    learning one specific skill—like dialog—at a time, and then move on to another
    one when I felt I’d sufficiently improved. This one-at-a-time approach also works
    if you’re learning something that’s less skill-based and more knowledge-based.
