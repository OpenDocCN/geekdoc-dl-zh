    to assign a given text to one of several predefined categories. Message roles
    in this dialogue are simple and complementary: the system message describes the
    task and lists the allowed classes, while the user message contains the text fragment
    to be assigned to one of those classes. This order — system first, then user —
    establishes an unambiguous context in which the model responds predictably and
    consistently.'

    is a structure with `role` and `content` keys. `role` indicates the source (system
    or user), and `content` carries the text. Separating roles lets you initialize
    the model’s behavior up front and then pass in the specific input. In the simplest
    case, the system message sets rules and style, and the user message formulates
    the task. For example, if you want a playful poem about a happy carrot, you might
    first set the instruction `{''role'': ''system'', ''content'': "You are an assistant
    who replies in a playful poet’s style."}`, then send `{''role'': ''user'', ''content'':
    "Write a very short poem about a happy carrot."}`. The very same user request
    would produce a different tone and format under a different system context, which
    is why the `system → user` sequence is key to controlling model behavior.'

    to separate work messages from personal and spam (categories: Work, Personal,
    Spam). A suitable system message might be: “Classify the following email as Work,
    Personal, or Spam.” with a sample user message: “Great discounts on our new electronics!
    Click now and save.” For movie review sentiment, distinguish “Positive”, “Negative”,
    and “Neutral”: the system message could be “Determine the sentiment of the following
    movie review: Positive, Negative, or Neutral.” and the user message: “Visually
    stunning, but the plot is predictable and shallow.” For news, classify the topic
    as Politics, Technology, Sports, or Entertainment: “Determine the topic of the
    news item: Politics, Technology, Sports, or Entertainment.” with “A new smartphone
    model uses breakthrough technology that’s reshaping the industry.”'

    “Based on the review, assign a rating from 1 to 5 stars.” and “The design is interesting,
    but frequent breakdowns and weak support make it hard to recommend.” When routing
    customer requests, common intents are Billing, Support, Sales, or General Question
    — “Identify the intent of the request: Billing, Support, Sales, or General Question.”
    and “Tell me about available plans and current promotions.” For text genre classification,
    use categories like Fiction, Non‑fiction, Poetry, News — “Identify the genre of
    the text: Fiction, Non‑fiction, Poetry, or News.” and “In the heart of the city,
    among noisy streets, there was a garden untouched by time.”'

    or Irritated. A fitting system message: “Determine the tone of the following post:
    Serious, Ironic, Inspiring, or Irritated.” with a user example: “There’s nothing
    better than starting the day with a smile. Happiness is contagious!” In academic
    writing, classify the field: Biology, Computer Science, Psychology, or Mathematics
    — “Identify the field of the following abstract: Biology, Computer Science, Psychology,
    or Mathematics.” and “This study examines the algorithmic complexity of sorting
    methods and their efficiency.” In food reviews, you might extract the flavor profile:
    Sweet, Salty, Sour, Bitter, Umami — “Identify the flavor profile in the review:
    Sweet, Salty, Sour, Bitter, or Umami.” and “A dish with a perfect balance of umami
    and a light sweetness that enhances the taste.” Finally, for emergency calls,
    quickly determine the situation type: Fire, Medical, Crime, or Other — “Identify
    the emergency type from the call transcript: Fire, Medical, Crime, or Other.”
    and “The building next door is filled with smoke; we can see flames. Please help
    urgently!” In all of these cases, the key to quality answers is a clear system
    message that defines the boundaries and lists the categories; the user message
    remains a concise carrier of the text to be labeled.'
