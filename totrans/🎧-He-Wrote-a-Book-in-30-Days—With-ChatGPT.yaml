    is Seth‚Äôs third data science book. He challenged himself to write it in under
    a month after realizing how much faster he could work by teaming up with ChatGPT
    plugin [Advanced Data Analysis](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8437071-advanced-data-analysis-chatgpt-enterprise-version).
    Along the way, Seth discovered something else: AI made the process of writing
    this book way more fun. He handed off all the boring parts of data analysis, like
    writing code to generate charts from datasets, to AI. This freed him to focus
    on the part that he loves‚Äîthinking up questions designed to uncover insights from
    a dataset.'

    is a fascinating read, but it‚Äôs also an experiment in how AI is revolutionizing
    creative pursuits. In a world where AI is making every question that humans know
    the answer to immediately answerable, the real differentiator is asking the right
    questions‚Äîa skill that Seth isn‚Äôt just exceptionally good at, but also finds joy

    have the most success in. ChatGPT attempts to identify which sport has the most
    athletes with physical attributes that resemble mine by filtering the dataset

    of my height or five kilograms (11 pounds) of my weight.
