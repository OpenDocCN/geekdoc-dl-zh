    for radical self-betterment. We do an over-the-shoulder screen share where she
    feeds the tool a list of her old journal entries, and we watch as ChatGPT conducts
    the most thorough and insightful annual review and goal-setting session you‚Äôve
    ever seen. It writes a year-by-year personal biography of her life, helps her
    set goals for 2024, and points out blindspots she might‚Äôve missed.

    beings have collected via the internet, it is like an external hard drive for
    our brain,‚Äù she says.'

    pages and pages of self-reflection,‚Äù she says. She considers ChatGPT to be a tool

    sample the whole terrain‚Ä¶you can say that I‚Äôm struggling with this set of symptoms‚Ä¶what

    to us, that actually can, not only summarize, but can build upon, can question,
