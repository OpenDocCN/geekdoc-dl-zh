    and—now—a power user of ChatGPT. She and I recently spent a week together merging
    our mutual interest in psychology with the best of AI—and she’s taken that experience

    for radical self-betterment. We do an over-the-shoulder screen share where she
    feeds the tool a list of her old journal entries, and we watch as ChatGPT conducts
    the most thorough and insightful annual review and goal-setting session you’ve
    ever seen. It writes a year-by-year personal biography of her life, helps her
    set goals for 2024, and points out blindspots she might’ve missed.

    to forget things, and Gena recommends that we use ChatGPT to remember. “As a large
    language model that has access to much of the accumulated knowledge that human
    beings have collected via the internet, it is like an external hard drive for
    our brain,” she says.'

    a journaling practice](https://every.to/p/from-fake-it-till-you-make-it-to-remember-what-you-know),
    Gena believes that we can feed our thoughts into ChatGPT to “get formulations
    that resonate with us in a way that crystallizes…what has been sprawled across
    pages and pages of self-reflection,” she says. She considers ChatGPT to be a tool
    for ambitious people to maintain and grow the working knowledge base on which
    they base their decisions, something she calls their “epistemic hygiene.”'

- en: '**ChatGPT is integrating the disparate fields of psychology**. As a practitioner
    of the mind, Gena is perennially frustrated by how fragmented psychology has been
    as a domain—until now. “ChatGPT is so incredibly powerful at allowing you to quickly
    sample the whole terrain…you can say that I’m struggling with this set of symptoms…what
    are the five big categories of treatments, and it can tell you reliably, which
    is mind-blowing,” she says.'

- en: '**AI as an informal advisor**. For Gena, ChatGPT has become part of the “menu
    of resources to consider” when she comes up against a challenge. “Is there some
    perspective to be gotten from my husband, my best friend, my informal advisor
    board, are there books to read…now, similarly, what can ChatGPT help me with here?”

- en: '**Budget-friendly biographer**. After processing Gena’s journal entries since
    2018, ChatGPT summarized the major events in her life and organized them by year.
    “I had that stage of my life mirrored back to me in this crystallized form where
    I could experience it…in one fell swoop,” she says.'

- en: '**Using ChatGPT to discover blind spots**. Gena acknowledges that ChatGPT is
    a neat summarizer, but she also values its ability to discover new things. After
    ChatGPT condensed the big events in her life, Gena probes it further, asking it
    what her blind spots are likely to be in the coming year (hint: It surfaces her
    “Achilles’ heel”).'

- en: '**Aiming higher with AI.** Most of ChatGPT’s initial responses focus on ensuring
    Gena doesn’t spread herself too thin, but Gena wants it to “fill out the other
    side of the…picture: Is it just that I’ll be too ambitious, or is there any way
    I might not be ambitious enough?” When she asks ChatGPT for the highest-leverage
    goals she should set for 2024, it comes up with a thoughtfully prioritized list.'

- en: '**Using ChatGPT to dialogue with ourselves**. Many people shrug off ChatGPT
    as “regurgita[ting]” information back to them, but Gena is amazed by its potential
    to allow us to interact with our thoughts. “To have a tool that actually talks
    to us, that actually can, not only summarize, but can build upon, can question,
    can consolidate, connect dots between all these different things that have been
    swimming around in our heads, it’s so groundbreaking,” she says.'
