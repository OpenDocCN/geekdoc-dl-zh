    information on who you are, and how you want ChatGPT to respond to you.

    with ChatGPT. Custom Instructions will help you turn ChatGPT into a personalized,
    always-on, super-smart coach and tutor that knows who you are, your strengths
    and weaknesses, and the people in your life, so it can help you make better decisions
    and achieve your goals. You won’t have to explain anything twice because it will
    already know enough context about you to help—and it will do so in ways that surprise
    and delight you.
