    the number-one custom GPT for programming, with an image or even a single word
    about your idea. As you watch the LLM process your request, Grimoire works with
    a web host on the backend, and just minutes later, your website will be live on
    the internet.

    more than just making websites: It includes a comprehensive guide to learning
    how to code, from basic concepts to advanced instruction, and serves as a tool
    for programmers to find answers to their questions in real time. What‚Äôs more,
    the GPT is fantasy-themed. With references to wizards, goblins, and other creatures
    of the enchanted realm, using Grimoire is like taking a coding class at Hogwarts.'

    was an iOS developer at Twitter until Musk bought the company and laid off a majority
    of its staff. With plenty of free time suddenly on his hands, Nick started experimenting
    with ChatGPT, and ended up building Grimoire. He‚Äôs since emerged as one of the
    foremost experts in the world on building successful custom GPTs and coding with
    ChatGPT.

    emerging way of coding by prompting AI‚Äîcan enable. I sat down with Nick to explore
    what this means about the future of programming, the best way to use the coding
    assistant, and the role AI plays in his life beyond coding. As we talk, Nick uses
    Grimoire to build a website about coffee and generate a QR code from its URL live
    on the show.

    already simplifying coding, and will continue to make it easier and quicker. ‚Äú[I]t''s

    he says.'

    how ‚Äúprompt-gramming‚Äù‚Äîcoding by prompting LLMs‚Äîis emerging as a new language for
    programming. ‚ÄúIt feels like this new era where I can give [LLMs] a prompt in English
    [and] it‚Äôll spit out a bunch of code,‚Äù Nick says.'

    is different from other custom GPTs because it has ‚Äútemplates‚Äù that allow people
    to jump right into a project, like making a link-in-bio website or doing a prompt-gram
    tutorial. He says ‚Äúpre-defin[ing] ideas‚Äù into the custom GPT ‚Äúsolve[s] the blank
    canvas problem‚Äù and ‚Äúgive[s] people a list of fun projects to do.‚Äù'

    to start a pre-built project, people can use it to help them code and build anything
    they‚Äôd like. The templates are just ‚Äúconversation starter button[s],‚Äù and ‚Äúbasically,
    you can come up with any idea.‚Äù'

    to illustrate his point that Grimoire can be used to bring any concept to life,
    he decides to use the tool to build a website about coffee. He prompts Grimoire
    with just two words‚Äî‚Äúcoffee website‚Äù‚Äîand this is what followed:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Streamline your creative process with AI**. In response to Nick‚Äôs prompt,
    Grimoire lists the components of a functional website, like the different pages
    it should include, and charts a detailed plan to build it. Nick thinks this is
    helpful because it ‚Äúbreak[s] the task into more parts‚Äù and ‚Äúexpand[s] on that
    initial thing.‚Äù'

    and Nick uses one that works with hosting provider [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
    to deploy the coffee website. ‚Äú[T]he website will be ephemeral and will delete
    itself after one hour, or you can claim it and sign up with Netlify,‚Äù Nick explains.'

    ‚Äúare now super easy with prompts.‚Äù'

    questions, a function he uses Grimoire for himself. ‚ÄúI''ll be working on a problem
    and I''ll have a quick question, like, ‚ÄòOh, this thing isn''t working‚Äô or ‚ÄòHow

    version of ChatGPT because it reduces the preparatory back-and-forth that one

    it into being more truthful, more helpful, more thoughtful,‚Äù he says.'

    over ChatGPT because of the hotkeys, or keyboard shortcuts, that he‚Äôs built into
    it. ‚ÄúI really found myself not wanting to type a lot,‚Äù he says, as he demonstrates
    a hotkey that saves code a user generates using Grimoire by automatically zipping
    and downloading it.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Stay focused with Grimoire**. On a more profound note, Nick also thinks that
    the finite options presented by the hotkeys ensures that he doesn‚Äôt get lost too
    far down a programming rabbit hole. ‚ÄúIt almost reels the thought back in a little
    bit and puts you back on a sane path,‚Äù he says.'
