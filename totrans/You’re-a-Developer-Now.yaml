    time figuring out how to use them. In our world, when people get magic powers,
    they mostly go about their day ignoring them.

    those who have never coded before to professional developers—how to build an AI
    chatbot. The key enabling technology is ChatGPT, which acts as a coding assistant,
    personal tutor, and coach for the students.

    Some aren’t even in tech: they’re lawyers or consultants or activists. None of
    them has ever considered themselves capable of coding and launching a product.
    And until recently, they weren’t.'

    in production in 30 days.

    design, write, and make good decisions without requiring years of training. [And
    it’s getting better all the time](https://every.to/napkin-math/automate-the-simple-with-stupid).

    C++*](https://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Days-5th/dp/0672327112). I spent
    weeks paging through it and plugging esoteric commands into my computer hoping
    I was doing it right. When something broke, I had no one to ask to help me. It
    was so hard.'

    the stuff I’d dreamed of, I spent months learning abstract concepts like variables,
    loops, and if statements. I almost gave up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s not the case today. With ChatGPT, even if you have zero technical skill,
    you can have a simple version of your dream app running in an hour. You don’t
    need to know how for loops or if statements work—you just need to know the right
    ChatGPT prompts.

    "I’m feeling super empowered using ChatGPT + Replit to code. I can now query APIs,
    and convert it to Markdown for local storage. All that in an afternoon, it''s
    crazy."'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s crazy indeed. And the empowerment people feel from learning to build things
    that actually work provides significant motivation to learn why and how. Rather
    than learning about functions and variables and for loops in isolation, you can
    directly see how they stack together to create the thing in front of you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for them are much more likely to stick around and become builders in this kind
    of setup. And ChatGPT isn’t just good at writing code—it’s also good at explaining
    it. If you paste a code snippet into it or explain a bug you’re running into,
    it’ll tell you how to fix it.

    get people to [script kiddie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie) their
    way into a demo. But that’s a far cry from becoming a professional production-ready
    developer.

    with AI. Learning to code with ChatGPT can be tricky. It can send you down rabbit
    holes that you don’t know how to get out of.
  prefs: []

    you’re writing, instead blindly following ChatGPTs directives, which are sometimes
    limited and out of date.

    required to be a great developer. There are significant benefits to reap from
    much of traditional programming education.
  prefs: []
