    run with a small team and not a lot of capital. I sat down with Ben to understand
    how he has integrated AI into his workflow to find business opportunities online,
    run these ventures efficiently, and evaluate their performance. As we talk, Ben
    takes me through the remarkable toolkit of AI tools he has assembled for each
    of these functions.

    AI tools to determine which one is most appropriate for a given use case is a
    valuable exercise. “Which tool is best for this thing versus I’m just going to
    default to ChatGPT for everything” is a question about which he often reminds
    himself.'

    his AI tool of choice is ChatGPT. He analyzes the model by asking ChatGPT questions
    like, “What''s a similar kind of business to this? Where else would this kind
    of thing be useful? How would you think about building that kind of company?”'

    that a solo entrepreneur could viably scale such a business to $500,000 a year.
    A leader in this industry is market intelligence company [Yardstiq](https://www.yardstiq.com/),
    which offers access to interviews conducted by analysts with Fortune 500 companies
    that use software tools, with the aim of helping prospective purchasers gain a
    deeper understanding of the software before making a big investment.

    to better understand the industry. Ben’s starting point was a screenshot shared
    by the Yardstiq CEO on Twitter that captured a transcribed snippet of an interview
    conducted by its analysts.

    Ben tried to reverse-engineer the questions Yardstiq analysts ask software clients
    during interviews. This is useful if Ben wants to build a similar kind of data
    company because “we have a[n] MVP, this is our very basic form for how we would
    go and ask people questions.”'

    snippets of other Yardstiq transcripts, to ChatGPT, prompting it to refine the
    questions it had previously generated. After doing this a few times and getting
    similar responses, he concluded, “That is most likely what the question is, given
    all of this data.”'

    Ben shifted his focus to other aspects of the business. He liked the copy on Yardstiq’s
    landing page “because it was just so on the nose,” and wondered how it could be
    even sharper, so he brainstormed with ChatGPT, asking it to “improve the landing
    page copy.”'

    strategies to curate content—incentivizing early reviewers by offering them rewards—reminds
    Ben of anonymous job review site [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm?countryPickerRedirect=true),
    leading him to wonder, “How did that start? How did they start getting people
    to write reviews on a site like that?” Intrigued, Ben started a new chat and asked
    ChatGPT about Glassdoor’s founding story and revenue model.'

    more efficiently. Ben launched the premium version of his newsletter [Ben’s Bites

    “AI sparring partners” integrated in his workflow has made the “actual process
    of creating a post so much more fluid.”

    him write a blog post. Gemini segments the information and highlights important
    quotes. “[I]t''s this strange writing partner that helps me do a lot of the work,”

    [Lex](https://lex.page/), the word processor [Every incubated](https://every.to/p/we-re-spinning-out-lex),

    explains that “it’s more like a smaller task than if I was trying to do this manually.”'

    that AI empowers solo entrepreneurs and small companies because “you spend less
    time doing the things that you don't want to be spending any time on and it helps
    you with the things that you want to spend time on, [to] do them more efficiently
    as well.”
