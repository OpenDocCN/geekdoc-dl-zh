    run with a small team and not a lot of capital. I sat down with Ben to understand
    how he has integrated AI into his workflow to find business opportunities online,
    run these ventures efficiently, and evaluate their performance. As we talk, Ben
    takes me through the remarkable toolkit of AI tools he has assembled for each
    of these functions.

    AI tools to determine which one is most appropriate for a given use case is a
    valuable exercise. ‚ÄúWhich tool is best for this thing versus I‚Äôm just going to
    default to ChatGPT for everything‚Äù is a question about which he often reminds

    his AI tool of choice is ChatGPT. He analyzes the model by asking ChatGPT questions
    like, ‚ÄúWhat''s a similar kind of business to this? Where else would this kind
    of thing be useful? How would you think about building that kind of company?‚Äù'

    that a solo entrepreneur could viably scale such a business to $500,000 a year.
    A leader in this industry is market intelligence company [Yardstiq](https://www.yardstiq.com/),
    which offers access to interviews conducted by analysts with Fortune 500 companies
    that use software tools, with the aim of helping prospective purchasers gain a
    deeper understanding of the software before making a big investment.

    to better understand the industry. Ben‚Äôs starting point was a screenshot shared
    by the Yardstiq CEO on Twitter that captured a transcribed snippet of an interview
    conducted by its analysts.

    Ben tried to reverse-engineer the questions Yardstiq analysts ask software clients
    during interviews. This is useful if Ben wants to build a similar kind of data
    company because ‚Äúwe have a[n] MVP, this is our very basic form for how we would
    go and ask people questions.‚Äù'

    snippets of other Yardstiq transcripts, to ChatGPT, prompting it to refine the
    questions it had previously generated. After doing this a few times and getting
    similar responses, he concluded, ‚ÄúThat is most likely what the question is, given
    all of this data.‚Äù'

    Ben shifted his focus to other aspects of the business. He liked the copy on Yardstiq‚Äôs
    landing page ‚Äúbecause it was just so on the nose,‚Äù and wondered how it could be
    even sharper, so he brainstormed with ChatGPT, asking it to ‚Äúimprove the landing
    page copy.‚Äù'

    leading him to wonder, ‚ÄúHow did that start? How did they start getting people

    ‚ÄúAI sparring partners‚Äù integrated in his workflow has made the ‚Äúactual process
