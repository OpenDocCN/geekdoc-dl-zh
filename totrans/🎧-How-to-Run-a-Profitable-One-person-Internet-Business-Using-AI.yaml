    run with a small team and not a lot of capital. I sat down with Ben to understand
    how he has integrated AI into his workflow to find business opportunities online,
    run these ventures efficiently, and evaluate their performance. As we talk, Ben
    takes me through the remarkable toolkit of AI tools he has assembled for each

    A leader in this industry is market intelligence company [Yardstiq](https://www.yardstiq.com/),
