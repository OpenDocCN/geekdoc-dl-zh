    of skills you need to be a programmer—you might act more like a guide or a manager
    in many instances than writing code yourself.  But he believes that programming

    we’re far away from automating programming completely, even though autonomous
    agents are popular right now. The problem with autonomous agents is that the errors
    they make compound. Each time the LLM gets called there’s a certain amount of
    errors, and by the time they get to the 10th loop on something they’re very likely
    to have gone off the rails.

  zh: 那并不意味着我们总体上需要更少的程序员。我认为我们离完全自动化编程还很远，即使自主代理现在很流行。自主代理的问题在于它们制造的错误会不断累积。每次调用

- en: The whole trend in software development over the last 70 years is towards more

    Take Microsoft for example—they put out a paper titled “First Contact With AGI”
    talking about GPT-4 (which they later renamed “Sparks of AGI”). Of course, that’s
    not science, it’s content-marketing. But when people read that and predictably

- en: On the other hand you have people who built their entire identity on freaking
    out about AGI, and the louder they freak out the more attention and funding they
    attract. So they’re incentivized to also overstate the capabilities. Then the
    labs benefit indirectly from the fear caused by doomers because they can raise
    more money on bigger valuations, and attract talent that feel like they’re working
    on existential problems. And that makes doomers freak out more. So there’s a perverse
    incentive to hype this technology and make it seem like superintelligence is just
    around the corner. The reality is, we’re very far from that.

  zh: 另一方面，有些人完全以对 AGI 的恐慌来建立他们的整个身份，而他们越是大声地感到恐慌，他们就越能吸引更多的关注和资金。因此，他们也被激励夸大这些能力。然后实验室间接受益于末日论者造成的恐惧，因为他们可以在更大的估值上筹集更多的资金，并吸引觉得自己在解决存在问题的人才。这又使末日论者感到更加恐慌。因此，有一种错误的激励来夸大这项技术，使其看起来超级智能就在眼前。现实是，我们离那还很远。
- en: GPT-2 to GPT-3 was the birth of a new technology. But GPT-3 to GPT-4 is an incremental

    going to have a very difficult time impacting the physical world enough to end
    humanity. Sure, if you connect GPT-4 to the US nuclear arsenal it could cause

- en: Mastering tasks in the real world requires considerable trial and error. While
    doomsday scenarios often depict AI as an omnipotent entity, such a notion inherently

  zh: 昨天，我在旧金山，我想驾车回到我们住的 South Bay。然后我输入了我们的地址，但我没有足够的电池可以到那里。特斯拉自动添加了一家位于我回家路上的超级充电站的地址，并使用自动驾驶把我带到那里。
- en: The vertical integration of the car, the AI, and the physical power station
    created this incredible experience. It allows Tesla to suck at a lot of things
    – like build quality issues – but because they can provide an unparalleled end-to-end
    experience they win.

  zh: 车辆、人工智能和物理动力站的垂直整合创造了令人难以置信的体验。它允许特斯拉在许多方面表现糟糕——比如建造质量问题——但由于他们能够提供无与伦比的端到端体验，他们获胜了。
- en: This type of bundling and vertical integration is something I’d recommend startups
    who want to build in AI think about as a strategy. It takes a certain type of
    founder who is very focused and able to do it for a really long time in order
    to build something like this.

  zh: 对于想要在人工智能领域构建东西的创业公司，我建议他们考虑这种捆绑和垂直整合作为一种策略。这需要一种非常专注且能够长时间做某事的创始人。
- en: It’s super hard. It will nearly kill you. And you can’t go for the vertical
    integration and bundling right out of the gate. There were a lot of startups founded
    around the time of Replit that tried to do this, and they all died. A few of them
    raised big seed rounds, and burned through it for five years, and closed the company.

  zh: 这太难了。这几乎会把你累死。而且你不能一开始就进行垂直整合和捆绑。有很多创业公司在 Replit 成立时期尝试过这样做，但它们都倒闭了。其中一些公司获得了大笔种子轮融资，然后在五年内烧掉了这笔钱，最后倒闭了。

- en: When we first started the company I expected the product would be powerful enough
    within a year that we could code Replit with Replit. But we just started getting
    to the point where that’s possible—so it took a few years.

  zh: 当我们刚开始公司的时候，我预计产品在一年内就会足够强大，以至于我们可以使用 Replit 编写 Replit。但我们刚刚开始达到这一点的时候——所以这花了几年的时间。

    of the market, and then you keep making it better and more complete over time.

  zh: 起初，它对学生来说非常有用。因此，它是市场下端的玩具，然后你可以随着时间的推移不断改进并完善它。
- en: Building a toy is helpful because it allows you to ship. You create progress
    for people like investors or talent to see, and it allows you to tell if you’re
    building something people find useful. Whereas if you’re hiding in a corner somewhere,
    even if you have infinite capital, it’s really hard to have the willpower to keep
    going.

  zh: 制作玩具很有帮助，因为它可以让你交付成果。你为像投资者或人才这样的人创造进展，它让你知道你是否在构建人们发现有用的东西。而如果你藏在某个角落里，即使你有无限的资本，也很难有足够的意志力继续前进。
- en: This stuff is important, but I don’t think founders should over-strategize.
    Just build something useful and get it into the hands of people. You want to think
    strategically, but don’t do it so early on that the magnitude of the challenge
    depresses you.

  zh: 这些东西很重要，但我认为创始人不应该过度战略化。只需构建一些有用的东西，并将其交到人们手中。你想要战略性地思考，但不要在太早的时候这样做，以至于挑战的巨大程度让你沮丧。
