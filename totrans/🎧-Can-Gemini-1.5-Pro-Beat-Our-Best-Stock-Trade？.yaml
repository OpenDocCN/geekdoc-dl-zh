    price was temporarily down because of the U.S.-China trade war, and from a long-term
    perspective, Nvidia was in a strong position because of its proprietary GPU architecture.
    We also thought that Nvidia‚Äôs market was likely to grow as machine learning and
    gaming increased the need for high-powered CPUs and computers.

    better investment using the power of Gemini Pro 1.5 and ChatGPT. Our investment
    thesis is to find a company with strong potential that is trading down for temporary
    reasons.

    a positive gross profit. I opened an account on investment platform [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/invest/)

    to identify companies that might be artificially depressed in their prices.‚Äù'

    it can only offer general investment advice, we prompt it to simulate Warren Buffett
    and help us choose a trading strategy. Jesse finds instructing AI to simulate
    experts valuable, explaining that it ‚Äúelicits a different kind of perspective
    from the LLM than just asking it a question flat-out because it''s trying to take
    advantage of whatever knowledge that it had about that person and things that
    co-occur with that person''s name on the internet.‚Äù'

    for companies with low price-to-earnings ratios on TradingView, targeting those
    that are lately underperforming but have demonstrated relative stability in the
    past few years. We get 29 results from TradingView, and Jesse suggests prompting
    Gemini to identify ‚Äúpoints of commonality‚Äù between them since ‚Äúlarge language
    models are amazing at clustering things.‚Äù'

    we notice a few companies with poor reputations. Jesse thinks it might be an ‚Äúinteresting
    opportunity‚Äù to find unpopular companies that also have a ‚Äúcrazy distribution

    be trading poorly because their brand is disliked.'

    Leveraging Gemini‚Äôs large context window, we upload GoGo‚Äôs earnings transcripts
    from 2022 and 2023, using about 100,000 tokens (exceeding the capacity of the
    publicly available version of ChatGPT), and ask Gemini whether the management
    is talking about upgrading its technology.'

    be priced into their stock and how would we figure that out?‚Äù'

    of ‚Äúfinding things that were down for a clear reason.‚Äù He thinks we should search
    for stocks that are trading down because of ‚Äúexogenous factors‚Äù‚Äîlike inflation
    or industry trends‚Äîinstead of filtering underperforming companies with a stock
    screener (which is what we did initially with TradingView). We think ChatGPT would
    be the best tool to answer this question, and it tells us that energy stocks are
    artificially depressed due to external reasons.

    thesis is finding companies that will benefit from ‚Äútechnology that they''ve built
    being adopted rapidly.‚Äù We ask ChatGPT and Gemini the same question, and find
    Gemini‚Äôs response to be better organized, even pre-empting our next query by including
    names of public stocks as examples.'

    strategy is a ‚Äúhighly scalable business model,‚Äù and we ask Gemini which publicly
    traded energy companies have this. Jesse chooses not to define ‚Äúhighly scalable‚Äù
    because he ‚Äúfind[s] that using LLMs is a task of continuously refining your question‚Ä¶and
    then you find some nuance and you kind of keep going and keep going.‚Äù'

    good results from Gemini or ChatGPT. So with just 15 minutes left on the clock,
    on Jesse‚Äôs recommendation, we switch tracks and choose a [special purpose acquisition
    company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spac.asp) (SPAC) to invest in.

    is incredible, Jesse thinks that large amounts of content aren‚Äôt easily findable
    on the internet because a lot of people are averse to having their context indexed
    by LLMs. He thinks solving this problem and leveraging ‚Äúanything that has a real
    time data source‚Äù to keep information updated are new avenues unlocked by large
    language models.'
